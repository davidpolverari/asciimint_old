Gene Ontology (GO) and similar biomedical ontologies are critical tools of today's genetic research. These ontologies are crafted through a painstaking process of manual editing, and their organization relies on the intuition of human curators. Here we describe a method that uses information theory to automatically organize the structure of GO and optimize the distribution of the information within it. We used this approach to analyze the evolution of GO, and we identified several areas where the information was suboptimally organized. We optimized the structure of GO and used it to analyze 10,117 gene expression signatures. The use of this new version changed the functional interpretations of 97.5\% (P {\textless} 10−3) of the signatures by, on average, 14.6\%. As a result of this analysis, several changes will be introduced in the next releases of GO. We expect that these formal methods will become the standard to engineer biomedical ontologies.
Every year, over 400,000 new articles enter the biomedical literature, creating an unprecedented corpus of knowledge that is impossible to explore with traditional means of literature consultation. This situation motivated the development of biomedical ontologies, structured information repositories that organize biomedical findings into hierarchical structures and controlled vocabularies. GO is arguably the most successful example of a biomedical ontology. GO is a controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in any organism and includes 26,514 terms organized along three dimensions: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. GO has become even more intensively used with the introduction of high-throughput genomic platforms because of its ability to categorize large amounts of information using a controlled vocabulary to group objects and their relationships.
Today, GO and other biomedical ontologies are the result of a painstaking, costly and slow process of manual curation that requires reaching a consensus among many experts to implement a change. Furthermore, the topology of GO has become critically important because of the introduction of gene set enrichment methods. These methods have allowed investigators to characterize the results of a high-throughput experiment in terms of coherent, knowledge-defined sets of genes (e.g., pathways, functional classes or chromosomal locations) rather than in terms of anecdotal evidence about single genes. GO has become a primary provider of these gene sets and researchers use its graphical structure to identify the specificity of a gene class so that they will compare classes of the same specificty. Previous studies have found that the structure of GO does not conform to expected intuitions regarding the structure and distributions of ontology terms. Gene enrichment methods typically use the structure of ontologies as a proxy for the specificity of a term or, in some cases, use automated procedures to identify structural biases and to compensate for them in the analysis. Unfortunately, in some cases, even these compensative methods are unable to reach the same conclusions of a well-calibrated ontology (Supplementary Notes 1).
The approach we advocate here aims to solve the problem at its root by optimizing the structure of the ontology so that it will indeed be an accurate representation of the informational specificity of any term in the ontology. This approach would not only avoid the necessity to compensate for biases but also improve the semantic transparency of the ontology structure. To do so, we introduce an automated method for engineering the structure of GO based on the information content of each single term. The intuition behind this method is that ontologies are information systems and, as such, they can be optimized using the well-established mathematics of information theory. Given its mathematical nature, this optimization process can be automated, thus producing a principled and scalable architecture to engineer GO and, analogously, other biomedical ontologies.
Our approach starts from the quantification of information contained in the terms of the ontology. The information content of a term is computed from the amount of annotation available for it relative to all other terms, and it is a measure of the surprise caused by labeling a gene with this term rather than with any other term (Supplementary Notes 2). For instance, if a term contains all genes, then it is not surprising for a given gene to be labeled with it, so this term does not contain much information. Thus, the more genes or gene products associated with a term, the less specific the term is and the less information is conveyed by it. This 'surprise factor' is called 'self-information', and information theory provides a formal definition for it (Fig. 1).
Using information theory, we analyzed the evolution of the information content of GO across time, examining 2 million genes across all the organisms encoded in the ontology annotations. This process highlighted information biases and inefficiencies that may affect the usage of GO and identified those areas of the ontology that were sub-optimally organized. The analysis identified three types of information inefficiencies in the structure of GO.

	doi = {10.1109/DEST.2007.372043},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a medical records digital ecosystem (MRDES) that enables efficient use of medical records for the purpose of correct patient identification, diagnosis, appointments scheduling and the like, in everyday life as well as in emergency situations. Medical records digital environment (MRDE) is populated by interconnected medical records digital components (MRDC). MRDC are combined together to support creation of a digital infrastructure that will provide standardized use of medical records within various regions, countries and even continents. If medical records are to be recognized by different digital components at different locations, standardization of data needs to take place. Ontologies can be used for this purpose. Instantiation of the Generic Medical Record Ontology concepts result in Specific Medical Record Ontologies that act as personalized medical records. Ontology files are machine readable and are suitable to be used within MRDES. One of the key MRDC includes medical record databases that contain personal medical records. Through use of ontologies for standardization of medical records from these different databases, one big virtual database is created that contains medical records of all people. Other key MRDCs are machine-readable personal medical records as well as screening components that read those records. The advantage is that one comprehensive format for the medical records is set within this digital ecosystem and this record can be accessed, read and understood regardless of what country this person is in. This advantage is of especial importance in emergency cases. The significance of this research lies in the unification of the advances of the ontology technology and ecosystem paradigm for the purpose of establishing worldwide standardization of medical records.},

The design of DESs requires the integration of a number of different and complementary technologies, including agent-based and self-organizing systems, ontologies, swarm intelligence, ambient intelligence, data mining, genetic algorithms, etc. The integration of multiple technologies and the resulting synergetic effects contribute to the creation of highly complex, dynamic, and powerful systems. The application of DESs within different domains has the power to transform these domains by giving them a more intelligent and a more dynamic nature. In this paper, we illustrate how a DES design methodology can be used to systematically create a Digital Health Ecosystem (DHES). We address the key steps associated with the DES design and focus specifically on the use of the electronic health records within the DHES.

	abstract = {The use of methodologies in software and knowledge engineering is very extensive due to their important advantages. In the case of the development of ontologies, until now, several methodological proposals have been presented for building ontologies. Some of these methodologies are designed for building ontologies from scratch or reusing other ontologies without modifying them, concretely, the following cases can be mentioned: the Cyc methodology, the approach proposed by Uschold and King, Grüninger and Fox's methodology, the KACTUS methodology, METHONTOLOGY and the SENSUS methodology. There is even a proposal for re-engineering ontologies, and several proposals for collaborative construction of ontologies. In this article, we describe the methodologies and check their degree of maturity, contrasting them with respect to the IEEE standard for software development. Before this, we justify to what extent this standard can be used. A conclusion to this study is that there is no completely mature methodological proposal for building ontologies, since there are some important activities and techniques that are missing in all these methodologies. However, all the methodologies do not have the same degree of maturity. In fact, METHONTOLOGY is a very mature methodology. The other conclusion of this article is that, although work to unify proposals can be interesting, maybe several approaches should coexist.},

	abstract = {Business process modeling entails the capture of a set of tasks that invariably model the functional behavior of a system. Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle. This contributes to a model that provides a more complete representation of the overall business process. The methods will assist in mitigating risk and facilitate the early discovery of non-functional requirements during systems development.},

benefit.Data Sources We updated our earlier reviews by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane
Library, Inspec, and ISI databases and consulting reference lists through
September 2004. Authors of 64 primary studies confirmed data or provided additional
information.Study Selection We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated
the effect of a CDSS compared with care provided without a CDSS on practitioner
performance or patient outcomes.Data Extraction Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data on methods, setting,
CDSS and patient characteristics, and outcomes.Data Synthesis One hundred studies met our inclusion criteria. The number and methodologic
quality of studies improved over time. The CDSS improved practitioner performance
in 62 (64\%) of the 97 studies assessing this outcome, including 4 (40\%) of
10 diagnostic systems, 16 (76\%) of 21 reminder systems, 23 (62\%) of 37 disease
management systems, and 19 (66\%) of 29 drug-dosing or prescribing systems.
Fifty-two trials assessed 1 or more patient outcomes, of which 7 trials (13\%)
reported improvements. Improved practitioner performance was associated with
CDSSs that automatically prompted users compared with requiring users to activate
the system (success in 73\% of trials vs 47\%; P = .02)
and studies in which the authors also developed the CDSS software compared
with studies in which the authors were not the developers (74\% success vs
28\%; respectively, P = .001).Conclusions Many CDSSs improve practitioner performance. To date, the effects on
patient outcomes remain understudied and, when studied, inconsistent.},

Design: Literature search on Medline, Embase, Inspec, Cinahl, Cochrane/Dare and analysis of high-quality systematic reviews (SRs) on CDSS in hospital settings. Two-stage inclusion procedure: (1) selection of publications on predefined inclusion criteria; (2) independent methodological assessment of preincluded SRs by the 11-item measurement tool, AMSTAR. Inclusion of SRs with AMSTAR score 9 or above. SRs were thereafter rated on level of evidence. Each stage was performed by two independent reviewers. Results: 17 out of 35 preincluded SRs were of high methodological quality and further analyzed. Evidence that CDSS significantly impacted practitioner performance was found in 52 out of 91 unique studies of the 16 SRs examining this effect (57\%). Only 25 out of 82 unique studies of the 16 SRs reported evidence that CDSS positively impacted patient outcomes (30\%). Conclusions: Few studies have found any benefits on patient outcomes, though many of these have been too small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinically important effects. There is significant evidence that CDSS can positively impact healthcare providers' performance with drug ordering and preventive care reminder systems as most clear examples. These outcomes may be explained by the fact that these types of CDSS require a minimum of patient data that are largely available before the advice is (to be) generated: at the time clinicians make the decisions.},

	abstract = {Reasoning strategies are a key component in many medical tasks, including decision making, clinical problem solving, and understanding of medical texts. Identification of reasoning strategies used by clinicians may prove critical to the optimal design of decision support systems. This paper presents a formal method of cognitive-semantic analysis for the identification and characterization of reasoning strategies deployed in medical tasks and demonstrates its use through specific examples. Although semantic analysis was originally developed in the investigation of knowledge structures, it can also be applied to identify the reasoning and decision processes used by physicians and medical trainees in clinical tasks. Assumptions underlying the methods, as well as illustrations of their use in diagnostic explanation tasks, are presented. We discuss semantic analysis in the context of the current interests in developing medical ontologies and argue that a frame-based propositional analytic methodology can provide a systematic way of addressing the construction of such ontologies. Although the application of propositional analysis methods has some limitations, we show how such limitations are being addressed and present some examples of information tools that have been developed to ease, and make more systematic, the process of analysis.},

	abstract = {Summary
Recent developments in biomedical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present a number of challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users, which compromises the culture of safety in the workplace. Because clinical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This, in turn, necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors related to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science in understanding nursing factors associated with patient safety. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance. Studies of clinical cognition can meaningfully inform and shape design, development and assessment of information systems. Furthermore, they have a decisive impact on whether information technology has a positive influence on human performance and are especially important in understanding and promoting safe practices. These issues are discussed in the context of clinical informatics with a focus on nursing practice.},

	abstract = {Iterative proportional fitting (IPF) is a widely used method for spatial microsimulation. The technique results in non-integer weights for individual rows of data. This is problematic for certain applications and has led many researchers to favour combinatorial optimisation approaches such as simulated annealing. An alternative to this is ‘integerisation’ of IPF weights: the translation of the continuous weight variable into a discrete number of unique or ‘cloned’ individuals. We describe four existing methods of integerisation and present a new one. Our method – ‘truncate, replicate, sample’ (TRS) – recognises that IPF weights consist of both ‘replication weights’ and ‘conventional weights’, the effects of which need to be separated. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) separate replication and conventional weights by truncation; (2) replication of individuals with positive integer weights; and (3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.},

Large databases of cellular pathways are being analyzed to understand the interrelationship among complex biological processes. Computer-aided detection is being applied to the analysis of routine imaging data including mammography and chest imaging to improve the accuracy and detection rate for population screening. The second major area of investigation uses computers to construct sophisticated mathematical models of individual cancer cells as well as larger systems using partial differential equations. These models are further refined with clinically available information to more accurately reflect living systems. One of the major obstacles in the partnership between physical scientists and the oncology community is communications. Standard ways to convey information must be developed. Future progress in computational oncology will depend on close collaboration between clinicians and investigators to further the understanding of cancer using these new approaches.},

	abstract = {Background Disability, functionality, and morbidity are often used to describe the health of the elderly. Although particularly important when planning health and social services, knowledge about their distribution and aggregation at different ages is limited. We aim to characterize the variation of health status in a 60+ old population using five indicators of health separately and in combination. Methods 3080 adults 60+ living in Sweden between 2001 and 2004 and participating at the SNAC-K population-based cohort study. Health indicators: number of chronic diseases, gait speed, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), disability in instrumental-activities of daily living (I-ADL), and in personal-ADL (P-ADL). Results Probability of multimorbidity and probability of slow gait speed were already above 60\% and 20\% among sexagenarians. Median MMSE and median I-ADL showed good performance range until age 84; median P-ADL was close to zero up to age 90. Thirty\% of sexagenarians and 11\% of septuagenarians had no morbidity and no impairment, 92\% and 80\% of them had no disability. Twenty-eight\% of octogenarians had multimorbidity but only 27\% had some I-ADL disability. Among nonagenarians, 13\% had severe disability and impaired functioning while 12\% had multimorbidity and slow gait speed. Conclusions Age 80-85 is a transitional period when major health changes take place. Until age 80, most people do not have functional impairment or disability, despite the presence of chronic disorders. Disability becomes common only after age 90. This implies an increasing need of medical care after age 70, whereas social care, including institutionalization, becomes a necessity only in nonagenarians.},

	abstract = {Modelling is fundamental to many fields of science and engineering. A model can be thought of as a representation of possible data one could predict from a system. The probabilistic approach to modelling uses probability theory to express all aspects of uncertainty in the model. The probabilistic approach is synonymous with Bayesian modelling, which simply uses the rules of probability theory in order to make predictions, compare alternative models, and learn model parameters and structure from data. This simple and elegant framework is most powerful when coupled with flexible probabilistic models. Flexibility is achieved through the use of Bayesian non-parametrics. This article provides an overview of probabilistic modelling and an accessible survey of some of the main tools in Bayesian non-parametrics. The survey covers the use of Bayesian non-parametrics for modelling unknown functions, density estimation, clustering, time-series modelling, and representing sparsity, hierarchies, and covariance structure. More specifically, it gives brief non-technical overviews of Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, infinite hidden Markov models, Indian buffet processes, Kingman’s coalescent, Dirichlet diffusion trees and Wishart processes.},

	abstract = {Background
The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular, the collection of methods known as ‘data mining’ offers methodological and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of predictive models within clinical environments.
Purpose
The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine.
Methods
We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons.
Results
The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to carry out data mining studies in this field.
Conclusions
Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it needs to address.},

Microsimulation models (MSM) appear similar to ABM through the representation of individual decision-making units, but there is a significant variation of emphasis between the two approaches. MSM are typically stochastic or rule-based, and with a strong applied policy focus. These characteristics are explored and elaborated through a number of examples. While MSM are often very rich in their representation of ‘structures’, ABM are usually better tuned to the analysis of ‘behaviours’. We therefore argue that there is a strong logic to considering the MSM and ABM approaches as complementary and to begin a search for hybrids which might combine the best features of both approaches.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation models that describe disease processes synthesize information from multiple sources and can be used to estimate the effects of screening and treatment on cancer incidence and mortality at a population level. These models are characterized by simulation of individual event histories for an idealized population of interest. Microsimulation models are complex and invariably include parameters that are not well informed by existing data. Therefore, a key component of model development is the choice of parameter values. Microsimulation model parameter values are selected to reproduce expected or known results though the process of model calibration. Calibration may be done by perturbing model parameters one at a time or by using a search algorithm. As an alternative, we propose a Bayesian method to calibrate microsimulation models that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach converges to the target distribution and use a simulation study to demonstrate its finite-sample performance. Although computationally intensive, this approach has several advantages over previously proposed methods, including the use of statistical criteria to select parameter values, simultaneous calibration of multiple parameters to multiple data sources, incorporation of information via prior distributions, description of parameter identifiability, and the ability to obtain interval estimates of model parameters. We develop a microsimulation model for colorectal cancer and use our proposed method to calibrate model parameters. The microsimulation model provides a good fit to the calibration data. We find evidence that some parameters are identified primarily through prior distributions. Our results underscore the need to incorporate multiple sources of variability (i.e., due to calibration data, unknown parameters, and estimated parameters and predicted values) when calibrating and applying microsimulation models.},

	abstract = {Background
Microsimulation models (MSMs) for health outcomes simulate individual event histories associated with key components of a disease process; these simulated life histories can be aggregated to estimate population-level effects of treatment on disease outcomes and the comparative effectiveness of treatments. Although MSMs are used to address a wide range of research questions, methodological improvements in MSM approaches have been slowed by the lack of communication among modelers. In addition, there are few resources to guide individuals who may wish to use MSM projections to inform decisions.

Methods
This article presents an overview of microsimulation modeling, focusing on the development and application of MSMs for health policy questions. We discuss MSM goals, overall components of MSMs, methods for selecting MSM parameters to reproduce observed or expected results (calibration), methods for MSM checking (validation), and issues related to reporting and interpreting MSM findings (sensitivity analyses, reporting of variability, and model transparency).

Conclusions
MSMs are increasingly being used to provide information to guide health policy decisions. This increased use brings with it the need both for better understanding of MSMs by policy researchers, and continued improvement in methods for developing and applying MSMs.},

The inevitable consequence of the current impasse is miscommunication among scientists within and across disciplines. We propose a set of concepts, together with their possible information-theoretic interpretations, which can be used to facilitate the Complex Systems Science discourse.

On the other hand, the term “topology” appears in a variety of publications in this and other ecologically oriented journals, but its use is varied and applied to a wide cross-section of ecological problems. These variable usages suggest that topology does not have a common meaning to all ecologists. Part of this confusion results from the fact that topological ways of seeing nature are both formally derived from mathematical origins, and informally derived from non-mathematical conceptualizations. Interestingly, parallels occur between both mathematically originated and conceptually originated topology with respect to object-oriented, network topologies (formally derived from Eulerian mathematics), and field-oriented, manifold topologies (formally derived from Poincaréian mathematics). Topological ways of understanding nature and addressing both theoretical and applied problems have served ecology well in the past, but this approach will be improved with a better, more unified understanding among ecologists as to the variety of meanings found and practiced in the science.},

	abstract = {Although pairwise interactions have always had a key role in ecology and evolutionary biology, the recent increase in the amount and availability of biological data has placed a new focus on the complex networks embedded in biological systems. The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

Traditional fields of thermodynamics and newer fields of non-linear dynamics including chaos theory and complex systems science can inform our understanding of the complexity of human health, illness and disease. Commonly accepted aspects of human health may be projected as probabilities over time creating curves of human health potential. Maximum health may be represented by maximum functional complexity. Complexity's relationship to entropy and energy can produce a complex surface that better models the human experience of health and illness from birth to death. Such a potential health trajectory uniting complexity and entropy expands upon earlier theories of health while allowing for unusual predictions and the novel opportunity to test and validate this model of human health.},

Objective The authors developed and empirically evaluated a new globally optimal de-identification algorithm that satisfies the k-anonymity criterion and that is suitable for health datasets.
Design Authors compared OLA (Optimal Lattice Anonymization) empirically to three existing k-anonymity algorithms, Datafly, Samarati, and Incognito, on six public, hospital, and registry datasets for different values of k and suppression limits.
Measurement Three information loss metrics were used for the comparison: precision, discernability metric, and non-uniform entropy. Each algorithm's performance speed was also evaluated.
Results The Datafly and Samarati algorithms had higher information loss than OLA and Incognito; OLA was consistently faster than Incognito in finding the globally optimal de-identification solution.
Conclusions For the de-identification of health datasets, OLA is an improvement on existing k-anonymity algorithms in terms of information loss and performance.},

The most significant of these features is the jettisoning of the default link between order and design, which is precisely the principle omitted by an influential series of papers in the BMJ.

Just novelty, without unpredictability and irreducibility, is sometimes called nominal emergence.CharacteristicsTaxonomy and HistoryThe concept of emergence captures the view that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. When G.H. Lewes introduced the term in 1875, it was linked to the view of irreducibility of the systems level to the level of components.

How does the biosphere maintain exactly the right conditions necessary for life as we know it? Gaia theory postulates that the biota regulates conditions at levels it needs for survival, but evolutionary biologists reject this explanation because it lacks a mechanistic basis. Similarly, the notion of self-organized criticality fails to recognize the importance of the heterogeneity and modularity of ecological systems. Ecosystems and the biosphere are complex adaptive systems, in which pattern emerges from, and feeds back to affect, the actions of adaptive individual agents, and in which cooperation and multicellularity can develop and provide the regulation of local environments, and indeed impose regularity at higher levels. The history of the biosphere is a history of coevolution between organisms and their environments, across multiple scales of space, time, and complexity.},

	abstract = {C-K theory is a unified Design theory and was first introduced in 2003 (Hatchuel and Weil 2003). The name “C-K theory” reflects the assumption that Design can be modelled as the interplay between two interdependent spaces with different structures and logics: the space of concepts (C) and the space of knowledge (K). Both pragmatic views of Design and existing Design theories define Design as a dynamic mapping process between required functions and selected structures. However, dynamic mapping is not sufficient to describe the generation of new objects and new knowledge which are distinctive features of Design. We show that C-K theory captures such generation and offers a rigorous definition of Design. This is illustrated with an example: the design of Magnesium-CO2 engines for Mars explorations. Using C-K theory we also discuss Braha and Reich’s topological structures for design modelling (Braha and Reich 2003). We interpret this approach as special assumptions about the stability of objects in space K. Combining C-K theory and Braha and Reich’s models opens new areas for research about knowledge structures in Design theories. These findings confirm the analytical and interpretative power of C-K theory.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on design management have helped us to better comprehend how companies can apply design to get closer to users and to better understand their needs; this is an approach usually referred to as user-centered design. Yet analysis of design-intensive manufacturers such as Alessi, Artemide, and other leading Italian firms shows that their innovation process hardly starts from a close observation of user needs and requirements. Rather, they follow a different strategy called design-driven innovation in this paper. This strategy aims at radically change the emotional and symbolic content of products (i.e., their meanings and languages) through a deep understanding of broader changes in society, culture, and technology. Rather than being pulled by user requirements, design-driven innovation is pushed by a firm's vision about possible new product meanings and languages that could diffuse in society. Design-driven innovation, which plays such a crucial role in the innovation strategy of design intensive firms, has still remained largely unexplored. This paper aims at providing a possible direction to fill this empty spot in innovation management literature. In particular, first it proposes a metamodel for investigating design-driven innovation in which a manufacturer's ability to understand, anticipate, and influence emergence of new product meanings is built by relying on external interpreters (e.g., designers, firms in other industries, suppliers, schools, artists, the media) that share its same problem: to understand the evolution of sociocultural models and to propose new visions and meanings. Managing design-driven innovation therefore implies managing the interaction with these interpreters to access, share, and internalize knowledge on product languages and to influence shifts in sociocultural models. Second, the paper proposes a possible direction to scientifically investigate the management of this networked and collective research process. In particular, it shows that the process of creating breakthrough innovations of meanings partially mirrors the process of creating breakthrough technological innovations. Studies of design-driven innovation may therefore benefit significantly from the existing body of theories in the field of technology management. The analysis of the analogies between these two types of radical innovations (i.e., meanings and technologies) allows a research agenda to be set for exploration of design-driven innovation, a relevant as well as underinvestigated phenomenon.},

	abstract = {A review of evaluation literature concerning CDSSs indicates that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the ‘gold standard’ for evaluation. While this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not well suited to answering questions concerning whether systems will be used or how they will be used. Because lack of use of CDSS has been of concern for some years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address those issues. This paper critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of the usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of systems performance or physicians’ behavior by focusing on ‘fit’ of the system with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory that informs many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations informed by social science theories. Lastly, it proposes a theoretical social science base of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It involves a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, care, and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach also is useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can increase understanding of many influences concerning informatics applications development and deployment.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that we should understand the process of IT design as the development of sociotechnical configurations. Drawing upon our experiences with an electronic patient record (EPR) on an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), we depict medical work practices as natural systems. Several considerations for design are developed. First, the EPR should not be overly structured with rationalistic and prefixed notions of the organization and content of medical work. Implementing structure is crucial, however, this should be derived from detailed, empirical knowledge of the practice involved. Second, it is crucial to ensure that the usage of the system will yield immediate benefits for primary users: the systems should support work, not generate it. Third, designing IT should include being aware of the socio–political nature of seemingly ‘neutral’ tools as EPRs.},

The core of this infrastructure is an internet platform that provides e-services and promotes the interoperability by enabling not only inter-communication among authorized healthcare professionals, but also sharing the Virtual Healthcare Record, an authoritative, multi-dimensional view on the patient health state.
The platform is implemented in the LuMiR project for Basilicata, an Italian region where integration of healthcare applications is required. The LUMIR approach, its origin and peculiarities are briefly presented. The project’s final target is the regional health digital ecosystem that interacts with the healthcare system for better supporting it. The agent-oriented paradigm emerges as a promising approach to map the autonomic healthcare systems and their users in virtual entities, and to add values such as flexibility, adaptability, and reusability. over traditional object- or service-oriented approaches.},

	abstract = {Digital ecosystems (DES) have recently been introduced into the computer and information societies. A digital ecosystem is the dynamic and synergetic complex of Digital Communities consisting of interconnected, interrelated and interdependent digital species situated in a digital environment, that interact as a functional unit and are linked together through actions, information and transaction flows. Digital ecosystems integrate various cutting-edge technologies including ontologies, agent-based and self-organizing systems, swarm intelligence, ambient intelligence, data mining etc. The synergetic effects of these methodologies results in a more efficient, effective, reliable and secure system. The application of DES within the health domain would transform the way in which health information is created, stored, accessed, used, managed, analyzed and shared, and would bring an innovative breakthrough within health domain. In this paper, we illustrate how the DES design methodology can be implemented within the health domain. We focus on the key factors associated with the DES design. The design methodology framework allows better control over the design process and serves as a navigating tool during the digital health ecosystems design.},

Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising features of natural ecosystems. These properties include populations of evolving agents, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions which generate local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial systems is then considered. An example architecture, the digital business ecosystem (DBE), is considered in detail. Simulation results imply that the DBE performs better at large scales than a comparable service-oriented architecture. These results suggest that incorporating ideas from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful self-organising properties in digital ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Summary
In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter Reichertz’ lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information systems in the future?

The following lines of development for HIS were considered as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based processing and storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; (2) the shift from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital information systems towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of patients and health consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals and administrators; (4) the use of HIS data not only for patient care and administrative purposes, but also for health care planning as well as clinical and epidemiological research; (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical HIS problems to those of change management as well as of strategic information management; (6) the shift from mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and now also to data on the molecular level; (7) the steady increase of new technologies to be included, now starting to include ubiquitous computing environments and sensor-based technologies for health monitoring.

As consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for institutional and (inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to explore new (transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for education in health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including appropriate knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system architectures, of adequate methods for strategic information management, of methods for modeling and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of comprehensive electronic patient records, providing appropriate access for health care professionals as well as for patients, in the broad sense as described here, e.g. including home care and health monitoring facilities.

Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004, we have to recognize that we imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS have become one of the most challenging and promising fields of research, education and practice for medical informatics, with significant benefits to medicine and health care in general.},

	abstract = {Background
Many eHealth technologies are not successful in realizing sustainable innovations in health care practices. One of the reasons for this is that the current development of eHealth technology often disregards the interdependencies between technology, human characteristics, and the socioeconomic environment, resulting in technology that has a low impact in health care practices. To overcome the hurdles with eHealth design and implementation, a new, holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies is needed, one that takes into account the complexity of health care and the rituals and habits of patients and other stakeholders.

Objective
The aim of this viewpoint paper is to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies by advocating a holistic approach toward their development and eventual integration in the health sector.

Methods
To identify the potential and limitations of current eHealth frameworks (1999–2009), we carried out a literature search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, PiCarta, and Google Scholar. Of the 60 papers that were identified, 44 were selected for full review. We excluded those papers that did not describe hands-on guidelines or quality criteria for the design, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth technologies (28 papers). From the results retrieved, we identified 16 eHealth frameworks that matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes were used to posit strategies and principles for a holistic approach toward the development of eHealth technologies; these principles underpin our holistic eHealth framework.

Results
A total of 16 frameworks qualified for a final analysis, based on their theoretical backgrounds and visions on eHealth, and the strategies and conditions for the research and development of eHealth technologies. Despite their potential, the relationship between the visions on eHealth, proposed strategies, and research methods is obscure, perhaps due to a rather conceptual approach that focuses on the rationale behind the frameworks rather than on practical guidelines. In addition, the Web 2.0 technologies that call for a more stakeholder-driven approach are beyond the scope of current frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we composed a holistic framework based on a participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques, and business modeling.

Conclusions
To demonstrate the impact of eHealth technologies more effectively, a fresh way of thinking is required about how technology can be used to innovate health care. It also requires new concepts and instruments to develop and implement technologies in practice. The proposed framework serves as an evidence-based roadmap.},

As a key sub-domain of Digital Ecosystems, Digital Health Ecosystems provide crucial services to maintain the health of the main participants of Digital Ecosystems. We are concerned with the large-scale, ambiguous, heterogeneous, and untrustworthy nature of health service information in Digital Health Ecosystems. An intensive survey found that current research cannot support accurate and trustworthy matchmaking between health service requests and health service advertisements in Digital Health Ecosystems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for a semantic service matchmaker that takes into account the ambiguous, heterogeneous nature of service information in Digital Health Ecosystems. This framework is designed to make four major contributions, which are health service domain knowledge modeling, online health service information disambiguation, health service query disambiguation and health service quality evaluation and ranking. In order to thoroughly evaluate this framework, we implement a prototype - a Semantic Health Service Search Engine, and conduct a series of experiments on the prototype using a functional testing and simulation approach. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Usability factors are a major obstacle to health information technology (IT) adoption. The purpose of this paper is to review and categorize health IT usability study methods and to provide practical guidance on health IT usability evaluation. 2025 references were initially retrieved from the Medline database from 2003 to 2009 that evaluated health IT used by clinicians. Titles and abstracts were first reviewed for inclusion. Full-text articles were then examined to identify final eligibility studies. 629 studies were categorized into the five stages of an integrated usability specification and evaluation framework that was based on a usability model and the system development life cycle (SDLC)-associated stages of evaluation. Theoretical and methodological aspects of 319 studies were extracted in greater detail and studies that focused on system validation (SDLC stage 2) were not assessed further. The number of studies by stage was: stage 1, task-based or user–task interaction, n=42; stage 2, system–task interaction, n=310; stage 3, user–task–system interaction, n=69; stage 4, user–task–system–environment interaction, n=54; and stage 5, user–task–system–environment interaction in routine use, n=199. The studies applied a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Methodological issues included lack of theoretical framework/model, lack of details regarding qualitative study approaches, single evaluation focus, environmental factors not evaluated in the early stages, and guideline adherence as the primary outcome for decision support system evaluations. Based on the findings, a three-level stratified view of health IT usability evaluation is proposed and methodological guidance is offered based upon the type of interaction that is of primary interest in the evaluation.},

A principle-based method of concept analysis provides the framework for exploring the nature of HISB. The authors reviewed approximately 100 published articles and five books reporting on HISB. Although HISB is a popular concept used in various contexts, most HISB definitions provide little insight into the concept's specific meanings. The authors describe the concept's characteristics, contributing to a clearer understanding of HISB, and discuss operationalizations, antecedents, and outcomes of HISB. Such an analysis of HISB might guide further theorizing on this highly relevant concept and assist health care providers in designing optimal informational interventions.},

A follow-up workshop was held in Braunschweig, Germany, for 2 days in May, 2013, with 20 invited international experts in biomedical and health informatics. Among other things it had the objectives to discuss the suggested goals and measures of 2002 and how priorities on MI research in this context should be set from the viewpoint of today. The goals from 2002 are now as up-to-date as they were then. The experts stated that the three goals: “patient-centred recording and use of medical data for cooperative care”; “process-integrated decision support through current medical knowledge” and “comprehensive use of patient data for research and health care reporting” have not been reached yet and are still relevant. A new goal for ICT in health care should be the support of patient centred personalized (individual) medicine. MI as an academic discipline carries out research concerning tools that support health care professionals in their work. This research should be carried out without the pressure that it should lead to systems that are immediately and directly accepted in practice.},

The emerging cloud computing appears well-suited to meet the demand of a broad set of health service scenarios. In particular, the concept of shared infrastructure and services provides the foundation for supporting healthcare service ecosystems. This paper proposes an ecosystem approach to identify high-level requirements for cloud computing technologies to provide hosting environments for sustainable healthcare ecosystems.

	doi = {10.1109/DEST.2007.372043},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a medical records digital ecosystem (MRDES) that enables efficient use of medical records for the purpose of correct patient identification, diagnosis, appointments scheduling and the like, in everyday life as well as in emergency situations. Medical records digital environment (MRDE) is populated by interconnected medical records digital components (MRDC). MRDC are combined together to support creation of a digital infrastructure that will provide standardized use of medical records within various regions, countries and even continents. If medical records are to be recognized by different digital components at different locations, standardization of data needs to take place. Ontologies can be used for this purpose. Instantiation of the Generic Medical Record Ontology concepts result in Specific Medical Record Ontologies that act as personalized medical records. Ontology files are machine readable and are suitable to be used within MRDES. One of the key MRDC includes medical record databases that contain personal medical records. Through use of ontologies for standardization of medical records from these different databases, one big virtual database is created that contains medical records of all people. Other key MRDCs are machine-readable personal medical records as well as screening components that read those records. The advantage is that one comprehensive format for the medical records is set within this digital ecosystem and this record can be accessed, read and understood regardless of what country this person is in. This advantage is of especial importance in emergency cases. The significance of this research lies in the unification of the advances of the ontology technology and ecosystem paradigm for the purpose of establishing worldwide standardization of medical records.},

The implications for how to better integrate evidence-based principles in behavioral medicine into oncology care through both spheres of development are discussed within the framework of the cancer control continuum. The promise of using the data collected through these tools to accelerate discovery in psycho-oncology is also discussed.

To ensure compliance under the law, the security and privacy requirements of relevant software systems must properly be aligned with these regulations. However, these regulations describe stakeholder rules, called rights and obligations, in complex and sometimes ambiguous legal language. These "rules" are often precursors to software requirements that must undergo considerable refinement and analysis before they become implementable. To support the software engineering effort to derive security requirements from regulations, we present a methodology for directly extracting access rights and obligations from regulation texts. The methodology provides statement-level coverage for an entire regulatory document to consistently identify and infer six types of data access constraints, handle complex cross references, resolve ambiguities, and assign required priorities between access rights and obligations to avoid unlawful information disclosures. We present results from applying this methodology to the entire regulation text of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.},

Health information systems (HIS) are dealing with processing data, information, and knowledge in health care environments. Especially with regard to chronic diseases, it becomes more and more important to organize health care in a patient-centric way, such that all participating in- or outpatient care institutions cooperate very closely. This is also denoted as integrated care. In integrated care it is necessary to provide relevant information not only within a single institution, but wherever and whenever it is needed. This includes medical practices, rehabilitation centers, nursing centers, and even the home of the patient. We therefore differentiate institutional and transinstitutional health information systems. In the following, we will introduce hospital information systems, which are the most complex instances of institutional information systems, and transinstitutional information systems. Throughout the book we will use the term health information system and the abbreviation HIS if we discuss aspects concerning both hospital information systems and transinstitutional information systems. If we deal with properties being unique for one of these, we will use the terms hospital information system and transinstitutional information system, respectively.},

It is argued that with the extended range of health information systems and the perspective of having adequate transinstitutional HIS architectures, a substantial contribution can be made to better patient-centered care, with possibilities ranging from regional, national to even global care. It is also argued that in applying health-enabling technologies, using ubiquitous, pervasive computing environments and ambient intelligence approaches, we can expect that in addition care will become more specific and tailored for the individual, and that we can achieve better personalized care. In developing health care systems towards transinstitutional HIS and health-enabling technologies, the aim of medical informatics, to contribute to the progress of the sciences and to high-quality, efficient, and affordable health care that does justice to the individual and to society, may be extended to also contributing to self-determined and self-sufficient (autonomous) life.

	abstract = {AbstractObjectives
The most important goal of a health information system (HIS) is improvement of quality, effectiveness and efficiency of health services. To achieve this goal, health care systems should be evaluated continuously. The aim of this paper was to study the impacts of HISs in Iran and the methods used for their evaluation.
Methods
We systematically searched all English and Persian papers evaluating health information systems in Iran that were indexed in SID, Magiran, Iran medex, PubMed and Embase databases until June 2013. A data collection form was designed to extract required data such as types of systems evaluated, evaluation methods and tools.
Results
In this study, 53 out of 1103 retrieved articles were selected as relevant and reviewed by the authors. This study indicated that 28 studies used questionnaires to evaluate the system and in 27 studies the study instruments were distributed within a research population. In 26 papers the researchers collected the information by means of interviews, observations, heuristic evaluation and the review of documents and records. The main effects of the evaluated systems in health care settings were improving quality of services, reducing time, increasing accessibility to information, reducing costs and decreasing medical errors.
Conclusion
Evaluation of health information systems is central to their development and enhancement, and to understanding their effect on health and health services. Despite numerous evaluation methods available, the reviewed studies used a limited number of methods to evaluate HIS. Additionally, the studies mainly discussed the positive effects of HIS on health care services.},

This need has recently led to the development of RadLex, a controlled terminology for radiology. The creation of RadLex has proved challenging in several respects: It has been difficult for users to peruse the large RadLex taxonomies and for curators to navigate the complex terminology structure to check it for errors and omissions. In this work, we demonstrate that the RadLex terminology can be translated into an ontology, a representation of terminologies that is both human-browsable and machine-processable. We also show that creating this ontology permits computational analysis of RadLex and enables its use in a variety of computer applications. We believe that adopting an ontology representation of RadLex will permit more widespread use of the terminology and make it easier to collect feedback from the community that will ultimately lead to improving RadLex.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and practice. Objective: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the Exploratory Workshop on “New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health Information Systems” (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April 2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The overall program was structured in three main parts: (a) discussion of problems and barriers to evaluation; (b) defining our visions and strategies with regard to evaluation of health information systems; and (c) organizing short-term and long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. Results: The workshop participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see Appendix B), comprising four observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. Conclusion: The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on further research on information systems’ evaluation.},

Evaluation of health information systems (HIS) enables the assessment of the extent to which HIS are fulfilling their objectives in supporting the services of healthcare delivery. This paper presents an overview of evaluation in health informatics and information systems.
Methods
Literature review on discourses, dimensions and methods of HIS and IS evaluation. A critical appraisal of selected HIS and IS evaluation frameworks is undertaken in order to identify HIS evaluation dimensions and measures. The frameworks are compared based on their inclusion of human, organizational and technological factors.
Results
We found that an increasing number of evaluation studies deal with two distinct trends of HIS: one considers human and organizational issues and the other is concerned with the employment of a subjectivist approach. Our review indicates that current evaluation methods complement each other in that they evaluate different aspects of HIS and they can be improved upon.
Conclusions
Evaluation is complex; it is easy to measure many things but not necessarily the right ones. Nevertheless, it is possible to consider, a HIS evaluation framework with more comprehensive and specific measures that would incorporate technological, human and organizational issues to facilitate HIS evaluation.},

	shorttitle = {User acceptance of information technology},
	abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of a good practice guideline to plan and perform scientifically robust evaluation studies in health informatics.
Methods
Issues to be addressed in evaluation studies were identified and guidance drafted based on the evaluation literature and on experiences by key players. Successive drafts of the guideline were discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts during conferences and by e-mail. At a fairly early point the guideline was put up for comments on the web.
Results
Sixty issues were identified that are of potential relevance for planning, implementation and execution of an evaluation study in the health informatics domain. These issues cover all phases of an evaluation study: Preliminary outline, study design, operationalization of methods, project planning, execution and completion of the evaluation study. Issues of risk management and project control as well as reporting and publication of the evaluation results are also addressed.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of issues is presented as a guideline for good evaluation practice in health informatics (GEP-HI). The strengths and weaknesses of the guideline are discussed. Application of this guideline will support better handling of an evaluation study, potentially leading to a higher quality of evaluation studies. This guideline is an important step towards building stronger evidence and thus to progress towards evidence-based health informatics.},

I explore what it is to know, what a theory is, and what it means to be scientific in the context of TAM. In particular, I review criteria for determining whether TAM is scientific or not in light of post-positivistic debates about the nature of science. For this purpose, I apply Popper's principle of demarcation, which determines whether a theory-like TAM-is falsifiable and the logical connection argument to show that connections between actions and intentions cannot be subjected to empirical testing similar to connections between chemical entities. I also draw on Kuhn's notion of scientific revolutions to observe the degree to which TAM has become normal science. Finally, I review TAM from the Lakatosian perspective of scientific research programs to evaluate whether the program is advancing or declining. My main objective is not to provide a conclusive evaluation of TAM as a research program or a paradigm, but to open the philosophical foundations of TAM for scrutiny so that it can be evaluated not only within the validation rules followed by its proponents, but by applying a set of well known criteria established in the post-positivistic views of science.},

We conducted a qualitative literature review of 45 conference papers describing telemedicine interventions in order to identify determinants that had influenced their implementation. The identified determinants, which would influence the future implementation of telemedicine interventions, can be classified into five major categories: (1) Technology, (2) Acceptance, (3) Financing, (4) Organization and (5) Policy and Legislation. Each category contains determinants that are relevant to different stakeholders in different domains. We propose a layered implementation model in which the primary focus on individual determinants changes throughout the development life cycle of the telemedicine implementation. For success, a visionary approach is required from the multidisciplinary stakeholders, which goes beyond tackling specific issues in a particular development phase. Thus the right philosophy is: 'start small, think big'.},

We reviewed 16 data sets analyzed in over 20 studies of clinicians using health IT for patient care. Studies differed greatly in samples and settings, health ITs studied, research models, relationships tested, and construct operationalization. Certain TAM relationships were consistently found to be significant, whereas others were inconsistent. Several key relationships were infrequently assessed. Findings show that TAM predicts a substantial portion of the use or acceptance of health IT, but that the theory may benefit from several additions and modifications. Aside from improved study quality, standardization, and theoretically motivated additions to the model, an important future direction for TAM is to adapt the model specifically to the health care context, using beliefs elicitation methods.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of guidelines for publication of evaluation studies of Health Informatics applications.
Methods
An initial list of issues to be addressed in reports on evaluation studies was drafted based on experiences as editors and reviewers of journals in Health Informatics and as authors of systematic reviews of Health Informatics studies, taking into account guidelines for reporting of medical research. This list has been discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts in Health Informatics evaluation during conferences and by using e-mail and has been put up for comments on the web.
Results
A set of STARE-HI principles to be addressed in papers describing evaluations of Health Informatics interventions is presented. These principles include formulation of title and abstract, of introduction (e.g. scientific background, study objectives), study context (e.g. organizational setting, system details), methods (e.g. study design, outcome measures), results (e.g. study findings, unexpected observations) and discussion and conclusion of an IT evaluation paper.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of principles relevant for properly describing Health Informatics evaluations has been developed. When manuscripts submitted to Health Informatics journals and general medical journals adhere to these aspects, readers will be better positioned to place the studies in a proper context and judge their validity and generalisability. It will also be possible to judge better whether papers will fit in the scope of meta-analyses of Health Informatics interventions. STARE-HI may also be used for study planning and hence positively influence the quality of evaluation studies in Health Informatics. We believe that better publication of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies is an important step toward the vision of evidence-based Health Informatics.
Limitations
This study is based on experiences from editors, reviewers, authors of systematic reviews and readers of the scientific literature. The applicability of the principles has not been evaluated in real practice. Only when authors start to use these principles for reporting, shortcomings in the principles will emerge.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the report is to review the evidence on the impact of consumer health informatics (CHI) applications on health outcomes, to identify the knowledge gaps and to make recommendations for future research.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, and CINAHL databases, references in eligible articles and the table of contents of selected journals; and query of experts.
METHODS: Paired reviewers reviewed citations to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the impact of CHI applications, and all studies that addressed barriers to use of CHI applications. All studies were independently assessed for quality. All data was abstracted, graded, and reviewed by 2 different reviewers.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-six eligible articles were identified including 121 RCTs. Studies were very heterogeous and of variable quality. Four of five asthma care studies found significant positive impact of a CHI application on at least one healthcare process measure. In terms of the impact of CHI on intermediate health outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one intermediate health outcome of; all three identified breast cancer studies, 89 percent of 32 diet, exercise, physical activity, not obesity studies, all 7 alcohol abuse studies, 58 percent of 19 smoking cessation studies, 40 percent of 12 obesity studies, all 7 diabetes studies, 88 percent of 8 mental health studies, 25 percent of 4 asthma/COPD studies, and one of two menopause/HRT utilization studies. Thirteen additional single studies were identified and each found evidence of significant impact of a CHI application on one or more intermediate outcomes. Eight studies evaluated the effect of CHI on the doctor patient relationship. Five of these studies demonstrated significant positive impact of CHI on at least one aspect of the doctor patient relationship. In terms of the impact of CHI on clinical outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one clinical outcome of; one of three breast cancer studies, four of five diet, exercise, or physical activity studies, all seven mental health studies, all three identified diabetes studies. No studies included in this review found any evidence of consumer harm attributable to a CHI application. Evidence was insufficient to determine the economic impact of CHI applications.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite study heterogeneity, quality variability, and some data paucity, available literature suggests that select CHI applications may effectively engage consumers, enhance traditional clinical interventions, and improve both intermediate and clinical health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Structured AbstractObjective:The objective of the report was to review the evidence on the impact of health information technology (IT) on all phases of the medication management process (prescribing and ordering, order communication, dispensing, administration and monitoring as well as education and reconciliation), to identify the gaps in the literature and to make recommendations for future research.Data sources:We searched peer-reviewed electronic databases, grey literature, and performed hand-searches. Databases searched included MEDLINE,® EMBASE,® CINAHL® (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts,© Compendex,© INSPEC© (which includes IEEE®), Library and Information Science Abstracts,® E-Prints in Library and Information Science,® PsycINFO,® Sociological Abstracts,© and Business Source® Complete. Grey literature searching involved Internet searching, reviewing relevant Web sites, and searching electronic databases of grey literatures. AHRQ also provided all references in their e-Prescribing, bar coding, and CPOE knowledge libraries.Methods:Paired reviewers looked at citations to identify studies on a range of health IT used to assist in the medication management process (MMIT) during multiple levels of screening (titles and abstracts, full text and final review for assignment of questions and data abstrction). Randomized controlled trials and cohort, case-control, and case series studies were independently assessed for quality. All data were abstracted by one reviewer and examined by one of two different reviewers with content and methods expertise.Results:40,582 articles were retrieved. After duplicates were removed, 32,785 articles were screened at the title and abstract phase. 4,578 full text articles were assessed and 789 articles were included in the final report. Of these, 361 met only content criteria and were listed without further abstraction. The final report included data from 428 articles across the seven key questions. Study quality varied according to phase of medication management. Substantially more studies, and studies with stronger comparative methods, evaluated prescribing and monitoring. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems were studied more than any other application of MMIT. Physicians were more often the subject of evaluation than other participants. Other health care professionals, patients, and families are important but not studied as thoroughly as physicians. These nonphysicians groups often value different aspects of MMIT, have diverse needs, and use systems differently. Hospitals and ambulatory clinics were well-represented in the literature with less emphasis placed on long-term care facilities, communities, homes, and nonhospital pharmacies. Most studies evaluated changes in process and outcomes of use, usability, and knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Most showed moderate to substantial improvement with implementation of MMIT. Economics studies and those with clinical outcomes were less frequently studied. Those articles that did address economics and clinical outcomes often showed equivocal findings on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MMIT systems. Qualitative studies provided evidence of strong perceptions, both positive and negative, of the effects of MMIT and unintended consequences. We found little data on the effects of forms of medications, conformity, standards, and open source status. Much descriptive literature discusses implementation issues but little strong evidence exists. Interest is strong in MMIT and more groups and institutions will implement systems in the next decades, especially with the Federal Government’s push toward more health IT to support better and more cost-effective health care.Conclusions:MMIT is well-studied, although on closer examination of the literature the evidence is not uniform across phases of medication management, groups of people involved, or types of MMIT. MMIT holds the promise of improved processes; clinical and economics studies and the understanding of sustainability issues are lacking.},

	abstract = {Structured AbstractObjectives:An evidence report was prepared to assess the evidence base regarding benefits and costs of health information technology (HIT) systems, that is, the value of discrete HIT functions and systems in various healthcare settings, particularly those providing pediatric care.Data Sources:PubMed®, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register, and the Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) were electronically searched for articles published since 1995. Several reports prepared by private industry were also reviewed.Review Methods:Of 855 studies screened, 256 were included in the final analyses. These included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, studies that tested a hypothesis, and predictive analyses. Each article was reviewed independently by two reviewers; disagreement was resolved by consensus.Results:Of the 256 studies, 156 concerned decision support, 84 assessed the electronic medical record, and 30 were about computerized physician order entry (categories are not mutually exclusive). One hundred twenty four of the studies assessed the effect of the HIT system in the outpatient or ambulatory setting; 82 assessed its use in the hospital or inpatient setting. Ninety-seven studies used a randomized design. There were 11 other controlled clinical trials, 33 studies using a pre-post design, and 20 studies using a time series. Another 17 were case studies with a concurrent control. Of the 211 hypothesis-testing studies, 82 contained at least some cost data. We identified no study or collection of studies, outside of those from a handful of HIT leaders, that would allow a reader to make a determination about the generalizable knowledge of the study's reported benefit. Beside these studies from HIT leaders, no other research assessed HIT systems that had comprehensive functionality and included data on costs, relevant information on organizational context and process change, and data on implementation.A small body of literature supports a role for HIT in improving the quality of pediatric care. Insufficient data were available on the costs or cost-effectiveness of implementing such systems.The ability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve the quality of care in ambulatory care settings was demonstrated in a small series of studies conducted at four sites (three U.S. medical centers and one in the Netherlands). The studies demonstrated improvements in provider performance when clinical information management and decision support tools were made available within an EHR system, particularly when the EHRs had the capacity to store data with high fidelity, to make those data readily accessible, and to help translate them into context-specific information that can empower providers in their work.Despite the heterogeneity in the analytic methods used, all cost-benefit analyses predicted substantial savings from EHR (and health care information exchange and interoperability) implementation: The quantifiable benefits are projected to outweigh the investment costs. However, the predicted time needed to break even varied from three to as many as 13 years.Conclusions:HIT has the potential to enable a dramatic transformation in the delivery of health care, making it safer, more effective, and more efficient. Some organizations have already realized major gains through the implementation of multifunctional, interoperable HIT systems built around an EHR. However, widespread implementation of HIT has been limited by a lack of generalizable knowledge about what types of HIT and implementation methods will improve care and manage costs for specific health organizations. The reporting of HIT development and implementation requires fuller descriptions of both the intervention and the organizational/economic environment in which it is implemented.},

	abstract = {Structured AbstractObjectives:We reviewed the evidence on the barriers and drivers to the use of interactive consumer health information technology (IT) by specific populations, namely the elderly, those with chronic conditions or disabilities, and the underserved.Data Sources:We searched MEDLINE®, CINHAHL®, PsycINFO®, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC, and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) AgeLine® databases. We focused on literature 1990 to present.Methods:We included studies of all designs that described the direct use of interactive consumer health IT by at least one of the populations of interest. We then assessed the quality and abstracted and summarized data from these studies with regard to the level of use, the usefulness and usability, the barriers and drivers of use, and the effectiveness of the interactive consumer health IT applications.Results:We identified and reviewed 563 full-text articles and included 129 articles for abstraction. Few of the studies were specifically designed to compare the elderly, chronically ill, or underserved with the general population. We did find that several types of interactive consumer health IT were usable and effective in multiple settings and with all of our populations of interest. Of the studies that reported the impact of interactive consumer health IT on health outcomes, a consistent finding of our review was that these systems tended to have a positive effect when they provided a complete feedback loop that included (a) monitoring of current patient status, (b) interpretation of this data in light of established, often individualized, treatment goals, (c) adjustment of the management plan as needed, (d) communication back to the patient with tailored recommendations or advice, and (e) repetition of this cycle at appropriate intervals. Systems that provided only one or a subset of these functions were less consistently effective.The barriers and drivers to use were most often reported as secondary outcomes. Many studies were hampered by usability problems and unreliable technology, primarily due to the research being performed on early stage system prototypes. However, the most common factor influencing the successful use of the interactive technology by these specific populations was that the consumers' perceived a benefit from using the system. Convenience was an important factor. It was critical that data entry not be cumbersome and that the intervention fit into the user's daily routine. Usage was more successful if the intervention could be delivered on technology consumers used every day for other purposes. Finally, rapid and frequent interactions from a clinician improved use and user satisfaction.Conclusions:The systems described in the studies we examined depended on the active engagement of consumers and patients and the involvement of health professionals, supported by the specific technology interventions. Questions remain as to (a) the optimal frequency of use of the system by the patient, which is likely to be condition-specific; (b) the optimal frequency of use or degree of involvement by health professionals; and (c) whether the success depends on repeated modification of the patient's treatment regimen or simply ongoing assistance with applying a static treatment plan. However, it is clear that the consumer's perception of benefit, convenience, and integration into daily activities will serve to facilitate the successful use of the interactive technologies for the elderly, chronically ill, and underserved.},

	abstract = {Structured AbstractObjectives:The main objective of the report is to review the evidence on the impact of health information technology (IT) that supports patient-centered care (PCC) on: health care processes; clinical outcomes; intermediate outcomes (patient or provider satisfaction, health knowledge and behavior, and cost); responsiveness to needs and preferences of patients; shared decisionmaking and patient–clinician communication; and access to information. Additional objectives were to identify barriers and facilitators for using health IT to deliver PCC, and to identify gaps in evidence and information needed by patients, providers, payers, and policymakers.Data Sources:MEDLINE®, Embase®, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, INSPEC, and Compendex databases through July 31, 2010.Methods:Paired members of our team reviewed citations to identify randomized controlled trials of PCC-related health IT interventions and studies that addressed barriers and facilitators for health IT for delivery of PCC. Independent assessors rated studies for quality. Paired reviewers abstracted data.Results:The search identified 327 eligible articles, including 184 articles on the impact of health IT applications implemented to support PCC and 206 articles addressing barriers or facilitators for such health IT applications. Sixty-three articles addressed both questions. The study results suggested positive effects of PCC-related health IT interventions on health care process outcomes, disease-specific clinical outcomes (for diabetes mellitus, heart disease, cancer, and other health conditions), intermediate outcomes, responsiveness to the needs and preferences of patients, shared decisionmaking, patient-clinician communication, and access to medical information.Studies reported a number of barriers and facilitators for using health IT applications to enable PCC. Barriers included: lack of usability; problems with access to the health IT application due to older age, low income, education, cognitive impairment, and other factors; low computer literacy in patients and clinicians; insufficient basic formal training in health IT applications; physicians’ concerns about more work; workflow issues; problems related to new system implementation, including concerns about confidentiality of patient information; depersonalization; incompatibility with current health care practices; lack of standardization; and problems with reimbursement. Facilitators for the utilization of health IT included ease of use, perceived usefulness, efficiency of use, availability of support, comfort in use, and site location.Conclusions:Despite marked heterogeneity in study characteristics and quality, substantial evidence exists confirming that health IT applications with PCC-related components have a positive effect on health care outcomes.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of investment in information technology (IT) by organizations worldwide has made user acceptance an increasingly critical technology implementation and management issue. While such acceptance has received fairly extensive attention from previous research, additional efforts are needed to examine or validate existing research results, particularly those involving different technologies, user populations, and/or organizational contexts. In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. Our results suggested that TAM was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant of attitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed.},

After critically examining the very notions of ‘success’ and ‘failure’, and after discussing the problematic nature of lists of ‘critical success- or failure factors’, this paper discusses three myths that often hamper implementation processes. Alternative insights are presented, and illustrated with concrete examples. First of all, the implementation of a PCIS is a process of mutual transformation; the organization and the technology transform each other during the implementation process. When this is foreseen, PCIS implementations can be intended strategically to help transform the organization. Second, such a process can only get off the ground when properly supported by both central management and future users. A top down framework for the implementation is crucial to turn user-input into a coherent steering force, creating a solid basis for organizational transformation. Finally, the management of IS implementation processes is a careful balancing act between initiating organizational change, and drawing upon IS as a change agent, without attempting to pre-specify and control this process. Accepting, and even drawing upon, this inevitable uncertainty might be the hardest lesson to learn.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r =.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

This new model is moderately supported by an analysis of data from over 600 individuals in two companies. This research highlights the importance of the fit between technologies and users' tasks in achieving individual performance impacts from information technology.

	abstract = {In this study, we use observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to evaluate freshwater storage trends in the north-central Middle East, including portions of the Tigris and Euphrates River Basins and western Iran, from January 2003 to December 2009. GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately −27.2±0.6 mm yr−1 equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km3 during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of “best current capabilities” in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3±2.1 mm yr−1 equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3±10.9 km3 in volume. Furthermore, results raise important issues regarding water use in transboundary river basins and aquifers, including the necessity of international water use treaties and resolving discrepancies in international water law, while amplifying the need for increased monitoring for core components of the water budget.},

This article describes the inequality empirically in broad strokes and then describes how it has led to the current deadlock in dealing with the problem of global climate change. Regarding bargaining positions in the Kyoto round of negotiations, two factions among rich nations and at least five distinct bargaining positions among poor nations are described and explained. The factional divisions are attributable to the differential influence of "polluting elites" across nations. The article concludes that the only way out of the conundrum of inequity and warming is by both addressing inequality and delinking carbon and development.},

	abstract = {In this study, we find from analyses of projections of 14 CMIP5 models a robust, canonical global response in rainfall characteristics to a warming climate. Under a scenario of 1\% increase per year of CO2 emission, the model ensemble projects globally more heavy precipitation (+7 - 2.4\%K -1), less moderate precipitation (-2.5 - 0.6\%K-1), more light precipitation (+1.8 - 1.3\%K-1), and increased length of dry (no-rain) periods (+4.7 - 2.1\%K-1). Regionally, a majority of the models project a consistent response with more heavy precipitation over climatologically wet regions of the deep tropics, especially the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Asian monsoon regions, and more dry periods over the land areas of the subtropics and the tropical marginal convective zones. Our results suggest that increased CO2 emissions induce a global adjustment in circulation and moisture availability manifested in basic changes in global precipitation characteristics, including increasing risks of severe floods and droughts in preferred geographic locations worldwide.

	abstract = {High-resolution, global quantification of fossil fuel CO2 emissions is emerging as a critical need in carbon cycle science and climate policy. We build upon a previously developed fossil fuel data assimilation system (FFDAS) for estimating global high-resolution fossil fuel CO2 emissions. We have improved the underlying observationally based data sources, expanded the approach through treatment of separate emitting sectors including a new pointwise database of global power plants, and extended the results to cover a 1997 to 2010 time series at a spatial resolution of 0.1°. Long-term trend analysis of the resulting global emissions shows subnational spatial structure in large active economies such as the United States, China, and India. These three countries, in particular, show different long-term trends and exploration of the trends in nighttime lights, and population reveal a decoupling of population and emissions at the subnational level. Analysis of shorter-term variations reveals the impact of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis with widespread negative emission anomalies across the U.S. and Europe. We have used a center of mass (CM) calculation as a compact metric to express the time evolution of spatial patterns in fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The global emission CM has moved toward the east and somewhat south between 1997 and 2010, driven by the increase in emissions in China and South Asia over this time period. Analysis at the level of individual countries reveals per capita CO2 emission migration in both Russia and India. The per capita emission CM holds potential as a way to succinctly analyze subnational shifts in carbon intensity over time. Uncertainties are generally lower than the previous version of FFDAS due mainly to an improved nightlight data set.},

	abstract = {A systematic review of telemedicine assessments based on searches of electronic databases between 1966 and December 2000 identified 66 scientifically credible studies that included comparison with a non-telemedicine alternative and that reported administrative changes, patient outcomes, or results of economic assessment. Thirty-seven of the studies (56\%) suggested that telemedicine had advantages over the alternative approach, 24 (36\%) also drew attention to some negative aspects or were unclear whether telemedicine had advantages and five (8\%) found that the alternative approach had advantages over telemedicine. The most convincing evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of telemedicine was given by some of the studies on teleradiology (especially neurosurgical applications), telemental health, transmission of echocardiographic images, teledermatology, home telecare and on some medical consultations. However, even in these applications, most of the available literature referred only to pilot projects and to short-term outcomes. Few papers considered the long-term or routine use of telemedicine. For several applications, including teleradiology, savings and sometimes clinical benefit were obtained through avoidance of travel and associated delays. Studies of home care and monitoring applications showed convincing evidence of benefit, while those on teledermatology indicated that there were cost disadvantages to health-care providers, although not to patients. Forty-four of the studies (67\%) appeared to have potential to influence future decisions on the telemedicine application under consideration. However, a number of these had methodological limitations. Although useful clinical and economic outcomes data have been obtained for some telemedicine applications, good-quality studies are still scarce and the generalizability of most assessment findings is rather limited.},

In the light of the markets, hierarchies and clans perspective, developed by Ouchi, this popularity becomes comprehensible.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Previous reviews have expressed concerns about the quality of telemedicine studies. There is debate about shortcomings and appropriate methodologies. The aim of this review of systematic reviews of telemedicine is to summarize methodologies used in telemedicine research, discuss knowledge gaps and recommendations and suggest methodological approaches for further research. Methods: We conducted a review of systematic reviews of telemedicine according to a protocol listing explicit methods, selection criteria, data collection and quality assessment procedures. We included reviews where authors explicitly addressed and made recommendations for assessment methodologies. We did a qualitative analysis of the reviews included, sensitized by two broad methodological positions; positivist and naturalistic approaches. The analysis focused on methodologies used in the primary studies included in the reviews as reported by the review authors, and methodological recommendations made by the review authors. Results: We identified 1593 titles/abstracts. We included 50 reviews that explicitly addressed assessment methodologies. One group of reviews recommended larger and more rigorously designed controlled studies to assess the impacts of telemedicine; a second group proposed standardisation of populations, and/or interventions and outcome measures to reduce heterogeneity and facilitate meta-analysis; a third group recommended combining quantitative and qualitative research methods; and others applying different naturalistic approaches including methodologies addressing mutual adaptations of services and users; politically driven action research and formative research aimed at collaboration to ensure capacity for improvement of services in natural settings. Conclusions: Larger and more rigorous studies are crucial for the production of evidence of effectiveness of unambiguous telemedicine services for pre defined outcome measures. Summative methodologies acknowledging telemedicine as complex innovations and outcomes as partly contingent on values, meanings and contexts are also important. So are formative, naturalistic methodologies that acknowledge telemedicine as ongoing collaborative achievements and engage with stakeholders, including patients to produce and conceptualise new and effective telemedicine innovations. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {The field of health technology assessment (HTA) is still relatively new, but it has shown remarkable growth over the last decade, having spread first from the United States to Europe, and now to the entire world. HTA seeks to couple evidence with decision-making, and thus has similarities to evidence-based health care and evidence-based policy-making. The early history of HTA, beginning around 1975, reveals a first period of synthesising available evidence—principally that dealing with efficacy and cost-effectiveness of health care interventions—so as to put it in a format helpful to health policy-makers, especially those in national governments. From 1985 or so, the focus of the second period was on seeking more effective links with these policy-makers, particularly in Europe. The most recent period, beginning in the late 1990s, has been increasingly devoted to more effective dissemination and implementation in order to influence administrators and clinicians. While early assessments tended to focus on large, expensive, machine-based technologies, the scope has gradually widened to include smaller technologies, ‘softer’ technologies (such as counselling), and health care needs. Actual assessments have also taken on broader issues, such as organisational, social, and ethical implications. In the Member States of the European Union (EU), HTA activities are increasingly visible, and almost all now have a national focus for HTA associated with the Ministry of Health or its equivalent. Central and Eastern European countries are also developing HTA activities. Most recently, HTA has been highlighted by health policy documents from the European Commission. It seems likely that HTA will in the future be institutionalised in some form as part of EU activities.},

	abstract = {This report is about how to improve health system outcomes in countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. Long-term historical trends indicate substantial room for improvement, especially when ECA's health outcomes are compared to those of the Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (EU-15). Instead of catching up with their Western neighbors, many countries in ECA have been falling behind. This report, which explores the development challenge facing health sectors in ECA, identifies three key agendas for achieving more rapid convergence with the world's best-performing health systems: (i) the first is the health agenda, in which the main imperative is to strengthen public health and primary care interventions to help achieve the 'cardiovascular revolution' that has taken place in the west in recent decades; (ii) the second is the financing agenda, in which growing demand for medical care must be satisfied without imposing an undue burden on households, by achieving better financial protection, or on government budgets, by ensuring a more efficient use of resources; and (iii) the third agenda relates to broader institutional arrangements. Here, a few key reform ingredients are identified, each of which is common to most advanced health systems but lacking in many ECA countries.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0266462308080343},
	abstract = {Health technology assessment (HTA) is a dynamic, rapidly evolving process, embracing different types of assessments that inform real-world decisions about the value (i.e., benefits, risks, and costs) of new and existing technologies. Historically, most HTA agencies have focused on producing high quality assessment reports that can be used by a range of decision makers. However, increasingly organizations are undertaking or commissioning HTAs to inform a particular resource allocation decision, such as listing a drug on a national or local formulary, defining the range of coverage under insurance plans, or issuing mandatory guidance on the use of health technologies in a particular healthcare system. A set of fifteen principles that can be used in assessing existing or establishing new HTA activities is proposed, providing examples from existing HTA programs. The principal focus is on those HTA activities that are linked to, or include, a particular resource allocation decision. In these HTAs, the consideration of both costs and benefits, in an economic evaluation, is critical. It is also important to consider the link between the HTA and the decision that will follow. The principles are organized into four sections: (i) “Structure” of HTA programs; (ii) “Methods” of HTA; (iii) “Processes for Conduct” of HTA; and (iv) “Use of HTAs in Decision Making.”},

	abstract = {Background: Experts consider health information technology key to improving efficiency and quality of health care. Purpose: To systematically review evidence on the effect of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of health care. Data Sources: The authors systematically searched the Englishlanguage literature indexed in MEDLINE (1995 to January 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Periodical Abstracts Database. We also added studies identified by experts up to April 2005. Study Selection: Descriptive and comparative studies and systematic reviews of health information technology. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted information on system capabilities, design, effects on quality, system acquisition, implementation context, and costs. Data Synthesis: 257 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies addressed decision support systems or electronic health records. Approximately 25\% of the studies were from 4 academic institutions that implemented internally developed systems; only 9 studies evaluated multifunctional, commercially developed systems. Three major benefits on quality were demonstrated: increased adherence to guideline-based care, enhanced surveillance and monitoring, and decreased medication errors. The primary domain of improvement was preventive health. The major efficiency benefit shown was decreased utilization of care. Data on another efficiency measure, time utilization, were mixed. Empirical cost data were limited. Limitations: Available quantitative research was limited and was done by a small number of institutions. Systems were heterogeneous and sometimes incompletely described. Available financial and contextual data were limited. Conclusions: Four benchmark institutions have demonstrated the efficacy of health information technologies in improving quality and efficiency. Whether and how other institutions can achieve similar benefits, and at what costs, are unclear.},

	doi = {10.1186/1477-7525-1-80},
	abstract = {The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. Since health is a function of length of life and quality of life, the QALY was developed as an attempt to combine the value of these attributes into a single index number. The QALY calculation is simple: the change in utility value induced by the treatment is multiplied by the duration of the treatment effect to provide the number of QALYs gained. QALYs can then be incorporated with medical costs to arrive at a final common denominator of cost/QALY. This parameter can be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of any treatment., Nevertheless, QALYs have been criticised on technical and ethical grounds. A salient problem relies on the numerical nature of its constituent parts. The appropriateness of the QALY arithmetical operation is compromised by the essence of the utility scale: while life-years are expressed in a ratio scale with a true zero, the utility is an interval scale where 0 is an arbitrary value for death. In order to be able to obtain coherent results, both scales would have to be expressed in the same units of measurement. The different nature of these two factors jeopardises the meaning and interpretation of QALYs. A simple general linear transformation of the utility scale suffices to demonstrate that the results of the multiplication are not invariant., Mathematically, the solution to these limitations happens through an alternative calculation of QALYs by means of operations with complex numbers rooted in the well known Pythagorean theorem. Through a series of examples, the new calculation arithmetic is introduced and discussed.},

To offer structure to the complexity of the decision-making process, the field of health technology assessment (HTA) was developed. This paper offers an introduction to the fundamental aspects of HTA and acts as a guide to the conduct of HTA for radiologists. First, the authors define HTA and describe how it is linked to the field of diagnostics. Second, a basic 11-step framework for the conduct of an HTA is outlined. The framework begins with the identification of the problem and proceeds through to the dissemination and impact of an HTA. Third, the authors provide a real-world example of an HTA in the field of diagnostics. Last, they describe the challenges and barriers faced in HTA.},

	abstract = {Purpose Improving medication safety has become a major topic in all clinical settings. Information technology (IT) can play an important role to prevent adverse drug events (ADEs), but data on the effectiveness of IT interventions are controversial. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review about the effects of IT interventions on medication safety in primary care.
Data sources PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, handsearching reference lists from full-text articles.
Study selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), if interventions based on IT, performed in primary care and outcomes reported on medication safety.
Data extraction Study characteristics and outcome data independently extracted by two reviewers. Disagreement resolved by discussion with a third reviewer.
Results of data synthesis Out of 3918 studies retrieved, 10 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Of the six studies evaluating computerized provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS) only 3 studies effectively reduced unsafe prescribing. Both pharmacist-led IT interventions decreased the prescription of potentially inappropriate medication or unsafe prescribing in pregnancy. No reduction of ADEs was achieved by a web program or a TeleWatch system intervention.
Conclusion Only 5 of 10 RCTs revealed a reduction of medication errors. CPOE with CDS was effective if targeted at a limited number of potentially inappropriate medications. The positive results of pharmacist-led IT interventions indicate that IT interventions with inter-professional communication appear to be effective. The unequivocal results of the included RCTs stress the necessity of rigorous evaluation prior to large-scale implementation.},

	abstract = {Objective To explore how key components of economic evaluations have been included in evaluations of health information systems (HIS), to determine the state of knowledge on value for money for HIS, and provide guidance for future evaluations.
Materials and methods We searched databases, previously collected papers, and references for relevant papers published from January 2000 to June 2012. For selection, papers had to: be a primary study; involve a computerized system for health information processing, decision support, or management reporting; and include an economic evaluation. Data on study design and economic evaluation methods were extracted and analyzed.
Results Forty-two papers were selected and 33 were deemed high quality (scores ≥8/10) for further analysis. These included 12 economic analyses, five input cost analyses, and 16 cost-related outcome analyses. For HIS types, there were seven primary care electronic medical records, six computerized provider order entry systems, five medication management systems, five immunization information systems, four institutional information systems, three disease management systems, two clinical documentation systems, and one health information exchange network. In terms of value for money, 23 papers reported positive findings, eight were inconclusive, and two were negative.
Conclusions We found a wide range of economic evaluation papers that were based on different assumptions, methods, and metrics. There is some evidence of value for money in selected healthcare organizations and HIS types. However, caution is needed when generalizing these findings. Better reporting of economic evaluation studies is needed to compare findings and build on the existing evidence base we identified.},

	abstract = {Background The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) approach, which provides scientific support for the decisions taken within the health field, is of increasing importance worldwide. In a context of limited resources, HTA has the potential of being an efficient tool for addressing the sustainability problems and the allocation choices arising from the constant increase in demand. Aim This study aims to investigate HTA use in nursing, both in terms of quantifying HTA evaluations of nursing phenomena which have been conducted and in terms of the extent to which nursing has used the HTA approach. The Italian context has been analysed because of the growing diffusion of the HTA in Italy along with the recent developments in the nursing profession. Methods A narrative review of international literature was undertaken using the following databases: HTA, PubMed, CINAHL, ILISI. Results Seventy evaluation studies on nursing were identified from the HTA database (1.12\% of all studies in the database). The areas of nursing intervention and the country of origin of the studies were identified. Two nursing studies on the HTA approach were found in the PubMed, CINAHL and HTA databases. The first focused on the evaluation of nursing technology process and analysed 126 studies in six main thematic areas; the second was a systematic review on HTA in nursing and analysed 192 studies (46 meta-analyses, 31 Finnish primary studies, 117 international primary studies). Three Italian studies were identified from the ILISI database and Italian grey literature. Discussion In the international literature, although analyses regarding the efficacy of nursing interventions have been conducted, there are to date very few research projects that focus exclusively on the HTA process as applied to nursing. The recent development of a standardized nursing language coupled with the open debate as to which research method (qualitative vs. quantitative) best serves to ‘read’ nursing phenomena may explain the scarce diffusion of HTA in the field of nursing.},

Medical informatics comprises a growing contribution to the technologies used in the delivery and management of health care. Diverse, evolving technologies include artificial neural networks, computer-assisted surgery, computer-based patient records, hospital information systems, and more. Decision-makers increasingly demand well-founded information to determine whether or how to develop these technologies, allow them on the market, acquire them, use them, pay for their use, and more. The development and wider use of health technology assessment (HTA) reflects this demand. While HTA offers systematic, well-founded approaches for determining the value of medical informatics technologies, HTA must continue to adapt and refine its methods in response to these evolving technologies.

Methods: The methods differ according to scope and purpose of each of the tools developed. They included, for example, literature reviews, surveys, Delphi and consensus methods, workshops, pilot tests, and internal/public consultation. Results: Practical results include an HTA Core Model and a Handbook on the use of the model, two pilot examples of HTA core information, an HTA Adaptation Toolkit for taking existing reports into new settings, a book about HTA and health policy making in Europe, a newsletter providing structured information about emerging/new technologies, an interactive Web-based tool to share information about monitoring activities for emerging/new technologies, and a Handbook on HTA capacity building for Member States with limited institutionalization of HTA. Conclusions: The tools provide high-quality information and methodological frameworks for HTA that facilitate preparation of HTA documentation, and sharing of information in and across national or regional systems. The tools will be used and further tested by partners in the EUnetHTA Collaboration aiming to (i) help reduce unnecessary duplication of HTA activities, (ii) develop and promote good practice in HTA methods and processes, (iii) share what can be shared, (iv) facilitate local adaptation of HTA information, (v) improve the links between health policy and HTA. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {This paper defines quality of health care. We suggest that there are two principal dimensions of quality of care for individual patients; access and effectiveness. In essence, do users get the care they need, and is the care effective when they get it? Within effectiveness, we define two key components — effectiveness of clinical care and effectiveness of inter-personal care. These elements are discussed in terms of the structure of the health care system, processes of care, and outcomes resulting from care. The framework relates quality of care to individual patients and we suggest that quality of care is a concept that is at its most meaningful when applied to the individual user of health care. However, care for individuals must placed in the context of providing health care for populations which introduces additional notions of equity and efficiency. We show how this framework can be of practical value by applying the concepts to a set of quality indicators contained within the UK National Performance Assessment Framework and to a set of widely used indicators in the US (HEDIS). In so doing we emphasise the differences between US and UK measures of quality. Using a conceptual framework to describe the totality of quality of care shows which aspects of care any set of quality indicators actually includes and measures and, and which are not included.},

Telecare, the delivery of health and social care to individuals within the home or wider community, with the support of information and communication technologies, has been advocated as an approach to reduce the rise in the number of elderly people in institutional care and to contain costs. A dynamic model is required to understand the systemic impact of telecare implementation over time. The paper cautions against overoptimistic expectations about the impact of telecare in the short term and emphasises that the benefits for healthcare systems may take a considerable time to be realised.

Some organizations, such as the American Telemedicine Association (ATA), have made the development of standards and guidelines a priority. The practice guidelines developed so far have been well received by the telemedicine community and are being adopted in numerous practices, as well as being used in research to support the practice and growth of telemedicine. Studies that utilize published guidelines not only help bring them into greater public awareness, but they also provide evidence needed to validate existing guidelines and guide the revision of future versions. Telemedicine will continue to grow and be adopted by more healthcare practitioners and patients in a wide variety of forms not just in the traditional clinical environments, and practice guidelines will be a key factor in fostering this growth. Creation of guidelines is important to payers and regulators as well as increasingly they are adopting and integrating them into regulations and policies. This paper will review some of the recent ATA efforts in developing telemedicine practice guidelines, review the role of research in guidelines development, review data regarding their use, and discuss some of areas where guidelines are still needed.},

	abstract = {In many countries health policy has been guided by a focus on the supply side factors of access to health care, a lot of attention being directed at the availability of services. This paper concentrates on the demand side of access and investigates relational factors that may limit people's subjective choice sets or their freedom to utilise health services, emphasising that relations between service providers and individuals are based on an interchange of information. It develops an argument for health communication strategies based on an interactive exchange of information as a means of improving access and is intended as a conceptual basis for further debate.
Trust assumes a key position within this transactional process of information exchange or communicative interaction. Information may enlarge individual choice sets and increase the freedom to use health care; it serves as a stimulus for access. The paper argues that trust plays a role in the utilisation of provided information. Trust emerges as a prerequisite of the effectiveness of information with regard to access. A discussion of the origins of trust shows that, while trust enhances communicative interaction, it is the process of communicative interaction that generates trust in the first place. Culturally diverse societies are often low-trust environments. The paper analyses the driving forces of trust and distrust in health care within these societies and delineates barriers for the individual and the community to the transfer of information. Specific characteristics of health communication turn out to be key determinants of access. In conclusion, principles for health policy on equity and information are derived which are rooted in a distinctive notion of democratic societal structure.},

Constructive technology assessment (CTA) was first described in the 1980s. In addition to the traditional HTA elements, this approach also takes into account the technology dynamics by emphasizing sociodynamic processes.

Results and conclusions: We define three main problem areas—the complexity of the evaluation object, the complexity of an evaluation project, and the motivation for evaluation. Many evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address those problems. Such a framework should help to formulate relevant questions, to find adequate methods and tools, and to apply them in a sensible way.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Previous reviews have expressed concerns about the quality of telemedicine studies. There is debate about shortcomings and appropriate methodologies. The aim of this review of systematic reviews of telemedicine is to summarize methodologies used in telemedicine research, discuss knowledge gaps and recommendations and suggest methodological approaches for further research.
Methods
We conducted a review of systematic reviews of telemedicine according to a protocol listing explicit methods, selection criteria, data collection and quality assessment procedures. We included reviews where authors explicitly addressed and made recommendations for assessment methodologies. We did a qualitative analysis of the reviews included, sensitized by two broad methodological positions; positivist and naturalistic approaches. The analysis focused on methodologies used in the primary studies included in the reviews as reported by the review authors, and methodological recommendations made by the review authors.
Results
We identified 1593 titles/abstracts. We included 50 reviews that explicitly addressed assessment methodologies. One group of reviews recommended larger and more rigorously designed controlled studies to assess the impacts of telemedicine; a second group proposed standardisation of populations, and/or interventions and outcome measures to reduce heterogeneity and facilitate meta-analysis; a third group recommended combining quantitative and qualitative research methods; and others applying different naturalistic approaches including methodologies addressing mutual adaptations of services and users; politically driven action research and formative research aimed at collaboration to ensure capacity for improvement of services in natural settings.
Conclusions
Larger and more rigorous studies are crucial for the production of evidence of effectiveness of unambiguous telemedicine services for pre defined outcome measures. Summative methodologies acknowledging telemedicine as complex innovations and outcomes as partly contingent on values, meanings and contexts are also important. So are formative, naturalistic methodologies that acknowledge telemedicine as ongoing collaborative achievements and engage with stakeholders, including patients to produce and conceptualise new and effective telemedicine innovations.},

	abstract = {Objective To provide an overview of health services research related to health technology assessment (HTA) and to identify research priorities from a European perspective.
Methods Several methods were used: systematic review of articles indexed with the MeSH term ‘technology assessment’ in PubMed from February 1999–2009; online survey among experts; and conference workshop discussions.
Results Research activity in HTA varies considerably across Europe. The research was categorised into six areas: (1) the breadth of analysis in HTA (such as economic, organizational and social aspects); (2) HTA products developed to meet the needs of policy-makers (such as horizon scanning, mini-HTA, and core HTA); (3) handling life-cycle perspectives in relation to technologies; (4) topics that challenge existing methods and for which HTA should be developed to address the themes more comprehensively (such as public health interventions and organizational interventions); (5) development of HTA capacity and programmes; and (6) links between policy and HTA. An online survey showed that the three areas that were given priority were the relationship between HTA and policy-making (71\%), the impact of HTA (62\%) and incorporating patient aspects in HTA (50\%). Policy-makers highlighted HTA and innovation processes as their main research priority (42\%). Areas that the systematic review identified as future priorities include issues within the six existing research areas such as disinvestment, developing evidence for new technologies, assessing the wider effects of technology use, and determining how HTA affects decision-making. In addition, relative effectiveness and individualized treatments are areas of growing interest.
Conclusions The research priorities identified are important for obtaining high quality and cost-effective health care in Europe. Managing the introduction, use and phasing out of technologies challenges health services throughout Europe, and these processes need to be improved to successfully manage future more general challenges. An ageing population and a diminishing workforce both require strong efforts to ensure effective and well-organized use of human resources and technologies. Furthermore, Europe needs to focus on innovation. This is closely linked to use of technologies and calls for future research.},

	abstract = {There are well-established frameworks for comparing the performance of health systems cross-nationally on multiple dimensions. A sub-set of such comprehensive schema is taken up by criteria specifically applied to health service delivery, including hospital performance.

We focus on evaluating hospital performance, using the New Zealand public hospital sector over the period 2001–2009 as a pragmatic and illustrative case study for cross-national application. We apply a broad three-dimensional matrix – efficiency, effectiveness, equity – each based on two measures, and we undertake ranking comparisons of 35 hospitals.

On the efficiency dimension – relative stay, day surgery – we find coefficients of variation of 10.8\% and 8.5\% respectively in the pooled data, and a slight trend towards a narrowing of inter-hospital variation over time. The correlation between these indicators is low (.20). For effectiveness – post-admission mortality, unplanned readmission – the coefficient of variation is generally higher (24.1\% and 12.2\%), and the trend is flat. The correlation is again low (.21). The equity dimension is assessed by quantifying the degree of ethnic and socio-economic variation for each hospital. The coefficient of variation is much higher – 40.7–66.5\% for ethnicity, 55.8–84.4\% for socio-economic position – the trend over time is mixed, and the correlation is moderate (.41). On averaging the rank of hospitals across all measures it is evident that there is limited consistency across the three constituent dimensions.

While it is possible to assess hospital performance across three dimensions using an illustrative set of standard measures derived from routine data, there appears to be little consistency in hospital rankings on these New Zealand data for the period 2001–2009. However, the methodology of using rankings derived from readily available data – possibly allied with multiple or composite indicator models – has potential for the cross-national comparison of hospital profiles, and assessments in three dimensions provide a more holistic and rounded account of performance.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of guidelines for publication of evaluation studies of Health Informatics applications.
Methods
An initial list of issues to be addressed in reports on evaluation studies was drafted based on experiences as editors and reviewers of journals in Health Informatics and as authors of systematic reviews of Health Informatics studies, taking into account guidelines for reporting of medical research. This list has been discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts in Health Informatics evaluation during conferences and by using e-mail and has been put up for comments on the web.
Results
A set of STARE-HI principles to be addressed in papers describing evaluations of Health Informatics interventions is presented. These principles include formulation of title and abstract, of introduction (e.g. scientific background, study objectives), study context (e.g. organizational setting, system details), methods (e.g. study design, outcome measures), results (e.g. study findings, unexpected observations) and discussion and conclusion of an IT evaluation paper.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of principles relevant for properly describing Health Informatics evaluations has been developed. When manuscripts submitted to Health Informatics journals and general medical journals adhere to these aspects, readers will be better positioned to place the studies in a proper context and judge their validity and generalisability. It will also be possible to judge better whether papers will fit in the scope of meta-analyses of Health Informatics interventions. STARE-HI may also be used for study planning and hence positively influence the quality of evaluation studies in Health Informatics. We believe that better publication of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies is an important step toward the vision of evidence-based Health Informatics.
Limitations
This study is based on experiences from editors, reviewers, authors of systematic reviews and readers of the scientific literature. The applicability of the principles has not been evaluated in real practice. Only when authors start to use these principles for reporting, shortcomings in the principles will emerge.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of a good practice guideline to plan and perform scientifically robust evaluation studies in health informatics.
Methods
Issues to be addressed in evaluation studies were identified and guidance drafted based on the evaluation literature and on experiences by key players. Successive drafts of the guideline were discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts during conferences and by e-mail. At a fairly early point the guideline was put up for comments on the web.
Results
Sixty issues were identified that are of potential relevance for planning, implementation and execution of an evaluation study in the health informatics domain. These issues cover all phases of an evaluation study: Preliminary outline, study design, operationalization of methods, project planning, execution and completion of the evaluation study. Issues of risk management and project control as well as reporting and publication of the evaluation results are also addressed.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of issues is presented as a guideline for good evaluation practice in health informatics (GEP-HI). The strengths and weaknesses of the guideline are discussed. Application of this guideline will support better handling of an evaluation study, potentially leading to a higher quality of evaluation studies. This guideline is an important step towards building stronger evidence and thus to progress towards evidence-based health informatics.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and practice. Objective: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the Exploratory Workshop on “New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health Information Systems” (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April 2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The overall program was structured in three main parts: (a) discussion of problems and barriers to evaluation; (b) defining our visions and strategies with regard to evaluation of health information systems; and (c) organizing short-term and long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. Results: The workshop participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see Appendix B), comprising four observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. Conclusion: The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on further research on information systems’ evaluation.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground and purpose
The generalised assumption of health information systems (HIS) success is questioned by a few commentators in the medical informatics field. They point to widespread HIS failure. The purpose of this paper was therefore to develop a better conceptual foundation for, and practical guidance on, health information systems failure (and success).
Methods
Literature and case analysis plus pilot testing of developed model.
Results
Defining HIS failure and success is complex, and the current evidence base on HIS success and failure rates was found to be weak. Nonetheless, the best current estimate is that HIS failure is an important problem. The paper therefore derives and explains the “design–reality gap” conceptual model. This is shown to be robust in explaining multiple cases of HIS success and failure, yet provides a contingency that encompasses the differences which exist in different HIS contexts. The design–reality gap model is piloted to demonstrate its value as a tool for risk assessment and mitigation on HIS projects. It also throws into question traditional, structured development methodologies, highlighting the importance of emergent change and improvisation in HIS.
Conclusions
The design–reality gap model can be used to address the problem of HIS failure, both as a post hoc evaluative tool and as a pre hoc risk assessment and mitigation tool. It also validates a set of methods, techniques, roles and competencies needed to support the dynamic improvisations that are found to underpin cases of HIS success.},

The goals from 2002 are now as up-to-date as they were then. The experts stated that the three goals: “patient-centred recording and use of medical data for cooperative care”; “process-integrated decision support through current medical knowledge” and “comprehensive use of patient data for research and health care reporting” have not been reached yet and are still relevant. A new goal for ICT in health care should be the support of patient centred personalized (individual) medicine. MI as an academic discipline carries out research concerning tools that support health care professionals in their work. This research should be carried out without the pressure that it should lead to systems that are immediately and directly accepted in practice.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of a good practice guideline to plan and perform scientifically robust evaluation studies in health informatics.
Methods
Issues to be addressed in evaluation studies were identified and guidance drafted based on the evaluation literature and on experiences by key players. Successive drafts of the guideline were discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts during conferences and by e-mail. At a fairly early point the guideline was put up for comments on the web.
Results
Sixty issues were identified that are of potential relevance for planning, implementation and execution of an evaluation study in the health informatics domain. These issues cover all phases of an evaluation study: Preliminary outline, study design, operationalization of methods, project planning, execution and completion of the evaluation study. Issues of risk management and project control as well as reporting and publication of the evaluation results are also addressed.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of issues is presented as a guideline for good evaluation practice in health informatics (GEP-HI). The strengths and weaknesses of the guideline are discussed. Application of this guideline will support better handling of an evaluation study, potentially leading to a higher quality of evaluation studies. This guideline is an important step towards building stronger evidence and thus to progress towards evidence-based health informatics.},

These new technologies have caught the attention of clinicians and policy makers because they seem to offer more rapid access to specialist care, and the potential to solve structural problems around inequalities of service provision and distribution. However, as a field of clinical practice, telehealthcare has consistently been criticised because of the poor quality of the clinical and technical evidence that its proponents have marshalled. The problem of ‘evidence’ is not a local one. In this paper, we undertake two tasks: first, we critically contrast the normative expectations of the wider field of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) with those configured within debates about Telehealthcare Evaluation; and second, we critically review models that provide structures within which the production of evidence about telehealthcare can take place. Our analysis focuses on the political projects configured within a literature aimed at stabilising evaluative knowledge production about telehealthcare in the face of substantial political and methodological problems.},

	abstract = {A review of evaluation literature concerning CDSSs indicates that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the 'gold standard' for evaluation. While this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not well suited to answering questions concerning whether systems will be used or how they will be used. Because lack of use of CDSS has been of concern for some years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address those issues. This paper critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of the usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of systems performance or physicians' behavior by focusing on 'fit' of the system with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory that informs many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations informed by social science theories. Lastly, it proposes a theoretical social science base of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It involves a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, care, and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach also is useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can increase understanding of many influences concerning informatics applications development and deployment. Copyright © 2001 .},

Methods: A variety of questions relevant to HIS and qualitative and quantitative methods ranging from simple before–after to controlled before–after and fully randomised designs, are discussed. A running example—evaluating the impact of an order communications system on lab requests—is used to illustrate the potential problems, and how they can be resolved. Results: The main types of biases affecting impact studies and methods to reduce them are described. The article then discusses some trade-offs between the low cost, easily conducted before–after study with its unreliable results versus the more complex, expensive but much more rigorous randomised trial. Conclusions: As would be expected, the correct methods to evaluate depend not on what technology is being evaluated—whether an information system or a drug—but on the questions the study is designed to answer, and how reliable the answers must be. Only those commissioning an evaluation study can decide these.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To consider the effects of contamination on the magnitude and statistical significance (or precision) of the estimated effect of an educational intervention, to investigate the mechanisms of contamination; and to consider how contamination can be avoided. Data sources: Major electronic databases were searched up to May 2005. Methods: An exploratory literature search was conducted. The results of trials included in previous relevant systematic reviews were then analysed to see whether studies that avoided contamination resulted in larger effect estimates than those that did not. Experts' opinions were elicited about factors more or less likely to lead to contamination. We simulated contamination processes to compare contamination biases between cluster and individually randomised trials. Statistical adjustment was made for contamination using Complier Average Causal Effect analytic methods, using published and simulated data. The bias and power of cluster and individually randomised trials were compared, as were Complier Average Causal Effect, intention-to-treat and per protocol methods of analysis. Results: Few relevant studies quantified contamination. Experts largely agreed on where contamination was more or less likely. Simulation of contamination processes showed that, with various combinations of timing, intensity and baseline dependence of contamination, cluster randomised trials might produce biases greater than or similar to those of individually randomised trials. Complier Average Causal Effect analyses produced results that were less biased than intention-to-treat or per protocol analyses. They also showed that individually randomised trials would in most situations be more powerful than cluster randomised trials despite contamination. Conclusions: The probability, nature and process of contamination should be considered when designing and analysing controlled trials of educational interventions in health. Cluster randomisation may or may not be appropriate and should not be uncritically assumed always to be a solution. Complier Average Causal Effect models are an appropriate way to adjust for contamination if it can be measured. When conducting such trials in future, it is a priority to report the extent, nature and effects of contamination. © Queen's Printer and controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.},

This paper develops and illustrates a conceptual model of these processes that we call Interactive Sociotechnical Analysis (ISTA). ISTA captures common types of interaction with special emphasis on recursive processes, i.e., feedback loops that alter the newly introduced HIT and promote second-level changes in the social system. ISTA draws on prior studies of unintended consequences, along with research in sociotechnical systems, ergonomics, social informatics, technology-in-practice, and social construction of technology. We present five types of sociotechnical interaction and illustrate each with cases from published research. The ISTA model should further research on emergent and recursive processes in HIT implementation and their unintended consequences. Familiarity with the model can also foster practitioners’ awareness of unanticipated consequences that only become evident during HIT implementation.},

	url = {http://meka.thl.fi/htacore/ViewApplication.aspx?id=11818},
	abstract = {Any health technology assessment (HTA) contains a vast amount of information. The content, focus, quality and reporting of HTAs vary a lot; this makes finding and transferring the information into local context difficult. The HTA Core Model tackles particularly this problem. The Model defines the content elements to be considered in an HTA and enables standardized reporting. The aim is to improve the applicability of an HTA in other national HTA projects, and enable actual collaboration between HTA agencies by providing a common framework for HTA production.

The HTA Core Model divides HTA information into standardized pieces referred to as assessment elements. An assessment element defines a piece of information that is relevant for the HTA. .The elements that are most likely to be useful for international sharing of information are defined as core elements. Each assessment element contains a question that one should consider including and answering for a specific technology. The Model provides methodological guidance to assist the answering of these questions, and a reporting tool (Fig 1). There is also a storage function for the question-answer pairs referred to as pool of structured HTA information.

The HTA Core Model, and the electronic tool supporting it the HTA Core Model Online, is used to produce the structured Core HTA information. A Core HTA is a project which provides the answers for all relevant core elements for a specific technology , considers the findings per domain in "domain discussions", and summarizes the most important findings. The model serves also those who wish to pick a free selection of elements to be answered. E.g. one could consider sharing certain pieces of information from a national HTA project by sharing them in the pool of structured HTA information with other European HTA agencies.

The HTA Core Model builds on earlier work of projects EUR-ASSESS1, HTA Europe (ref) and ECHTA/ECAHI as well as on other theoretical guidance (refs). It is loyal to the definitions of HTA that emphasize the multidisciplinary nature of assessments. It employs the nine domains that were originally identified in the EUR-ASSESS project (Table 1). Two first applications of the HTA Core Model, one for medical and surgical interventions (EUnetHTA 2008d) and the other for diagnostic technologies (EUnetHTA 2008c), were created during the EUnetHTA Project 2006-08.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Managing a patient’s expectations in the emergency department (ED) environment is challenging. Previous studies have identified several factors associated with ED patient satisfaction. Lengthy wait times have shown to be associated with dissatisfaction with ED care. Understanding that patients are inaccurate at their estimation of wait time, which could lead to lower satisfaction, provides administrators possible points of intervention to help improve accuracy of estimation and possibly satisfaction with the ED. This study was undertaken to examine the accuracy of patient estimates of time periods in an ED and identify factors associated with accuracy.

Method
In this prospective convenience sample survey at UTMC ED, we collected data between March and July 2012. Outcome measures included duration of each phase of ED care and patient estimates of these time periods.

Results
Among 309 participants, the majority underestimated the total length of stay (LOS) in the ED (median difference −7 minutes (IQR −29-12)). There was significant variability in ED LOS (median 155 minutes (IQR 75–240)). No significant associations were identified between accuracy of time estimates and gender, age, race, or insurance status. Participants with longer ED LOS demonstrated lower patient satisfaction scores (p{\textless}0.001).

Conclusion
Patients demonstrated inaccurate time estimates of ED treatment times, including total LOS. Patients with longer ED LOS had lower patient satisfaction scores.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Healthcare is characterized by complex cooperation between highly specialized healthcare departments. This often leads to inefficient clinical processes. In order to improve these processes, a systematic assessment method is needed. Such methods are still missing. The objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate a method to support the systematic and semi-automatic assessment of clinical processes, with special focus on the quality of information logistics. Methods: Criteria for the quality of information logistics were collected based on literature research and system analysis. Appropriate quality checks for these criteria were developed. An extended process modelling notation was developed. The method was evaluated in a pilot study. Results: An own model integrates four sub-models with each concentrating on distinct process aspects (i.e., control flow, data flow, tool usage, organizational information). In order to assess the quality of a process, selected process details are combined in "views". Weak points are then detected by applying specific rule-sets on these views. Each rule-set represents a pattern of critical cross-points which are searched for in the appropriate view-matrix. The MedFlow method was evaluated in a first pilot study in radiological departments - applying quality checks for the detection of e.g. media cracks or testing the transcription of information objects. Conclusion: Medflow method is best used to assess clinical processes regarding their control flow and information handling. The latter directly influences the quality of communication and thus the quality of whole processes. However, this must be evaluated in further studies. © 2007 Schattauer GmbH.},

Some have argued that environmental policy is different from other social policy fields, and thus attempting to establish causality through identification of counterfactual outcomes is quixotic. This chapter argues that elucidating causal relationships through counterfactual thinking and experimental or quasi-experimental designs is absolutely critical in environmental policy, and that many opportunities for doing so exist.

Many evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address those problems.

All electronic health (e-health) interventions require validation as health information technologies, ideally in randomized controlled trial settings. However, as with other types of complex interventions involving various active components and multiple targets, health informatics trials often experience problems of design, methodology, or analysis that can influence the results and acceptance of the research. Our objective was to review selected key methodologic issues in conducting and reporting randomized controlled trials in health informatics, provide examples from a recent study, and present practical recommendations.
Design
For illustration, we use the COMPETE III study, a large randomized controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of a shared decision-support system on the quality of vascular disease management in Ontario, Canada.
Results
We describe a set of methodologic, logistic, and statistical issues that should be considered when planning and implementing trials of complex e-health interventions, and provide practical recommendations for health informatics trialists.
Conclusions
Our recommendations emphasize validity and pragmatic considerations and would be useful for health informaticians conducting or evaluating e-health studies.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
Evaluation of health information systems (HIS) enables the assessment of the extent to which HIS are fulfilling their objectives in supporting the services of healthcare delivery. This paper presents an overview of evaluation in health informatics and information systems.
Methods
Literature review on discourses, dimensions and methods of HIS and IS evaluation. A critical appraisal of selected HIS and IS evaluation frameworks is undertaken in order to identify HIS evaluation dimensions and measures. The frameworks are compared based on their inclusion of human, organizational and technological factors.
Results
We found that an increasing number of evaluation studies deal with two distinct trends of HIS: one considers human and organizational issues and the other is concerned with the employment of a subjectivist approach. Our review indicates that current evaluation methods complement each other in that they evaluate different aspects of HIS and they can be improved upon.
Conclusions
Evaluation is complex; it is easy to measure many things but not necessarily the right ones. Nevertheless, it is possible to consider, a HIS evaluation framework with more comprehensive and specific measures that would incorporate technological, human and organizational issues to facilitate HIS evaluation.},

The objective of this article is to clarify their definitions and the relationships among key terms and concepts., Methods: This article used the relevant methods and policy literature as well as the websites of organizations engaged in evidence-based activities to develop a framework to explain the relationships among the terms EBM, HTA, and CER., Findings: This article proposes an organizing framework and presents a graphic demonstrating the differences and relationships among these terms and concepts., Conclusions: More specific terminology and concepts are necessary for an informed and clear public policy debate. They are even more important to inform decision making at all levels and to engender more accountability by the organizations and individuals responsible for these decisions.},

However, in the event of accidental device fracture or migration, the non-degradable nature of these materials risks intestinal obstruction. Here, we show that an elastic, pH-responsive supramolecular gel remains stable and elastic in the acidic environment of the stomach but can be dissolved in the neutral-pH environment of the small and large intestines. In a large animal model, prototype devices with these materials as the key component demonstrated prolonged gastric retention and safe passage. These enteric elastomers should increase the safety profile for a wide range of gastric-retentive devices.},

	abstract = {Information systems (IS) make it possible to improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness, which can provide competitive advantage. There is, however, a great deal of difficulty reported in the normative literature when it comes to the evaluation of investments in IS, with companies often finding themselves unable to assess the full implications of their IS infrastructure. Although many of the savings resulting from IS are considered suitable for inclusion within traditional accountancy frameworks, it is the intangible and non-financial benefits, together with indirect project costs that complicate the justification process. In exploring this phenomenon, the paper reviews the normative literature in the area of IS evaluation, and then proposes a set of conjectures. These were tested within a case study to analyze the investment justification process of a manufacturing IS investment. The idiosyncrasies of the case study and problems experienced during its attempts to evaluate, implement, and realize the holistic implications of the IS investment are presented and critically analyzed. The paper concludes by identifying lessons learnt and thus, proposes a number of empirical findings for consideration by decision-makers during the investment evaluation process.},

The research reported in this study has two primary objectives: (1) to propose a comprehensive theoretical model that incorporates valuable insights from two comple mentary streams of research, and (2) to empirically test the core of the model. At the heart of the new model is the assertion that for an information technology to have a positive impact on individual performance, the technology: (1) must be utilized and (2) must be a good fit with the tasks it supports. This new model is moderately supported by an analysis of data from over 600 individuals in two companies. This research highlights the importance of the fit between technologies and users' tasks in achieving individual performance impacts from information technology. It also suggests that task-technology fit, when decomposed into its more detailed components, could be the basis for a strong diagnostic tool to evaluate whether information systems and services in a given organization are meeting user needs.},

And why do we remember complicated stories but not complicated facts?In the course of over ten years of study, Chip and Dan Heath have established what it is that determines whether particular ideas or stories stick in our minds or not, and Made to Stick is the fascinating outcome of their painstaking research. Packed full of case histories and thought-provoking anecdotes, it shows, among other things, how one Australian scientist convinced the world he'd discovered the cause of stomach ulcers by drinking a glass filled with bacteria, how a gifted sports reporter got people to watch a football match by showing them the outside of the stadium, and how high-concept pitches such as 'Jaws on a spaceship' (Alien) and 'Die Hard on a bus' (Speed) convince movie executives to invest vast sums of money in a project on the basis of almost no information.Entertaining and informative by turns, this is a fascinating and multi-faceted account of a key area of human behaviour. At the same time, by showing how we can all use such cleverly devised strategies as the 'Velcro Theory of Memory' and 'curiosity gaps', it offers superbly practical insights, setting out principles we all can adopt to make sure that we get our ideas across effectively.},

Yet, observes Black, most of us are happy to accept uncritically such simplified, reductionist, and blatantly incorrect statements so long as they contain at least one number.
Researchers who use qualitative methods seek a deeper truth. They aim to “study things in their natural setting, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them,”2 and they use “a holistic perspective which preserves the complexities of human behaviour.”1
\#\#\#\# Summary points
Qualitative methods aim to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them
Qualitative research may define preliminary questions which can then be addressed in quantitative studies
A good qualitative study will address a clinical problem through a clearly formulated question and using more than one research method (triangulation)
Analysis of qualitative data can and should be done using explicit, systematic, and reproducible methods
Questions such as “How many parents would consult their general practitioner when their child has a mild temperature?” or “What proportion of smokers have tried to give up?” clearly need answering through quantitative methods. But questions like “Why do parents worry so much about their children's temperature?” and “What stops people giving up smoking?” cannot and should not be answered by leaping in and measuring the first aspect of the problem that we (the outsiders) think might be important.

The authors compared the 69 CPHIMS exam objectives against four health/medical informatics program course objectives as stated in the selected program’s online graduate catalog. Results showed that the two programs with management as a focus addressed the majority (67 and 59\%) of the CPHIMS objectives within core and elective courses combined. Overall, the other two programs addressed closer to a third of the CPHIMS objectives (36 and 32\%). This methodology could prove to be useful in assisting students interested in graduate-level training programs with a tool by which to measure the congruence of the curricula of different programs with the mission of the programs and with their own professional interests.},

However, significant differences in the cultures underlying these two disciplines pose barriers to a uniform educational solution. This paper recounts the experience at Columbia University in adapting a graduate program with an initial focus on clinical informatics to train bioinformaticians. The analysis begins by considering the development of the medical and biological informatics cultures over a 17-year period. Then we review how two separate curricula evolved to serve the needs of each group. Interviews with bioinformatics students and faculty indicated some dissatisfaction with the curriculum that developed within clinical informatics. Their comments are considered in the light of an analysis of the relationship between the application domains of biomedical informatics as a discipline. In response, a new curriculum was developed in which bioinformatics and clinical informatics are regarded as subdivisions of the same subject. A key feature of this curriculum is a new course, Theory and Methods in Biomedical Informatics, which presents informatics principles in their general form, and illustrates their application with examples drawn from across the biomedical spectrum. The paper concludes with suggestions for integrating informatics training programs at other institutions.},

Many proposed definitions focus on data, information, and knowledge, but do not provide an adequate definition of these terms. Leveraging insights from the philosophy of information, we define informatics as the science of information, where information is data plus meaning. Biomedical informatics is the science of information as applied to or studied in the context of biomedicine. Defining the object of study of informatics as data plus meaning clearly distinguishes the field from related fields, such as computer science, statistics and biomedicine, which have different objects of study. The emphasis on data plus meaning also suggests that biomedical informatics problems tend to be difficult when they deal with concepts that are hard to capture using formal, computational definitions. In other words, problems where meaning must be considered are more difficult than problems where manipulating data without regard for meaning is sufficient. Furthermore, the definition implies that informatics research, teaching, and service should focus on biomedical information as data plus meaning rather than only computer applications in biomedicine.},

This paper reviews these theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences and their role in addressing current and future needs in designing curricula, largely using illustrative examples drawn from medical education. The lessons of this past work are also applicable, however, to biomedical and health professional curricula in general, and to biomedical informatics training, in particular. We summarize empirical studies conducted over two decades on the role of memory, knowledge organization and reasoning as well as studies of problem-solving and decision-making in medical areas that inform curricular design. The results of this research contribute to the design of more informed curricula based on empirical findings about how people learn and think, and more specifically, how expertise is developed. Similarly, the study of practice can also help to shape theories of human performance, technology-based learning, and scientific and professional collaboration that extend beyond the domain of medicine. Just as biomedical science has revolutionized health care practice, research in the cognitive and learning sciences provides a scientific foundation for education in biomedicine, the health professions, and biomedical informatics.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Although public health informatics (PHI) was defined in 1995, both then and still now it is an “emerging” profession. An emergent profession lacks a base of “technical specialized knowledge.” Therefore, we analyzed MEDLINE bibliographic citation records of the PHI literature to determine if a base of technical, specialized PHI literature exists, which could lead to the conclusion that PHI has emerged from its embryonic state.
Method
A MEDLINE search for PHI literature published from 1980–2006 returned 16,942 records. Record screening by two subject matter experts netted 2493 PHI records that were analyzed by the intervals of previous PHI CBMs 96-4 and 2001-2 for 1980–1995 (I1980) and 1996–2000 (I1996), respectively, and a new, third interval of 2001–2006 (I2001).
Results
The distribution of records was 676 (I1980), 839 (I1996) and 978 (I2001). Annual publication rates were 42 (I1980), 168 (I1996), and 163 (I2001). Cumulative publications were accelerating. A subset of 19 (2.5\%) journals accounted for 730 (29.3\%) of the records. The journal subset average (±SD) annual publication rates of 0.7 ± 0.6 (I1980), 2.9 ± 1.9 (I1996), and 3.1 ± 2.7 (I2001) were different, F(3, 64) = 7.12, p \&lt; .05. Only I1980 was different (p \&lt; .05) from I1996 or I2001. Average (±SE) annual rate of increase for all journals (8.4 ± 0.8 publications per year) was different from the subset of 19 (2.7 ± 0.3), t(36) = 5.74, p \&lt; .05. MeSH first time-to-indexing narrowed from 7.3 (±4.3) years to the year (0.5 ± 0.8) the term was introduced, t(30) = 7.03, p \&lt; .05.
Conclusion
A core set of journals, the proliferation of PHI articles in varied and numerous journals, and rapid uptake of MeSH suggest PHI is acquiring professional authority and now should not be tagged as an “emerging” profession.},

The course delivery is through a mixture of real-time virtual classes, asynchronous online forums/resources, two capstone courses each summer as a 2-week intensive on-campus workshop, and a major workplace related field research project. Examples of innovation include the use of Web-based conferencing for real-time virtual classes, simulated tele-debriefing for policy/decision makers, roundtable sessions with chief information officers, modularized professional development courses, and joint field research project oversight with employers.

	abstract = {This paper describes a new distributed Master of Science degree program stream in health informatics (HI) at the University of Victoria, Canada, aimed at healthcare and information technology professionals working in the health setting. This is a part-time graduate program where students are required to complete 10 courses and a research project for the degree over 2 years. The course delivery is through a mixture of real-time virtual classes, asynchronous online forums/resources, two capstone courses each summer as a 2-week intensive on-campus workshop, and a major workplace related field research project. Examples of innovation include the use of Web-based conferencing for real-time virtual classes, simulated tele-debriefing for policy/decision makers, roundtable sessions with chief information officers, modularized professional development courses, and joint field research project oversight with employers. The paper then discusses the need to refine the program/course offering to ensure its consistency to current HI curriculum and competency standards, pleas for a coordinated approach to HI capacity building in Canada, and outlines planned next steps for the School in the coming year.},

	abstract = {This paper reports outcomes of a national survey of health informatics (HI) education and training carried out in the UK. A questionnaire to elicit details of HI and IT skills teaching was derived from a national consensus document (Learning to Manage Health Information, LtMHI). Forms were sent to all pre-qualification medical and nursing schools and to a stratified sample of postgraduate and post-registration programmes. Three case studies were carried out in acute hospital trusts to gain insight into opportunities for continuing professional development in health informatics and IT. Our evidence suggests that in the UK, health informatics is not yet integrated into the clinical curriculum. Nearly all the pre-qualification courses made some provision for teaching IT skills. Nonetheless, many respondents felt that students did not receive sufficient training. There was considerable variation in the amount of HI teaching provided in the different educational sectors. The case studies suggested very little HI training was provided for clinical staff and take-up of provision was not monitored. A number of factors are holding up progress, the most important being a lack of staff with the knowledge and skills to provide academic leadership. The paper outlines some steps that need to be taken to ensure health informatics is embedded in all clinical curricula.},

The implications for education and training in health informatics are given. Given the lack of knowledge with respect to the basics of health informatics of both health professionals and students, attention has to be paid to learning materials.

	abstract = {Objective
The field of Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) continues to define itself, and there are many educational programs offering ‘informatics’ degrees with varied foci. The goal of this study was to develop a scheme for systematic comparison of programs across the entire BMHI spectrum and to identify commonalities among informatics curricula.

Design
Guided by several published competency sets, a grounded theory approach was used to develop a program/curricula categorization scheme based on the descriptions of 636 courses offered by 73 public health, nursing, health, medical, and bioinformatics programs in the USA. The scheme was then used to compare the programs in the aforementioned five informatics disciplines.

Results
The authors developed a Course-Based Informatics Program Categorization (CBIPC) scheme that can be used both to classify coursework for any BMHI educational program and to compare programs from the same or related disciplines. The application of CBIPC scheme to the analysis of public health, nursing, health, medical, and bioinformatics programs reveals distinct intradisciplinary curricular patterns and a common core of courses across the entire BMHI education domain.

Limitations
The study is based on descriptions of courses from the university's webpages. Thus, it is limited to sampling courses at one moment in time, and classification for the coding scheme is based primarily on course titles and course descriptions.

Conclusion
The CBIPC scheme combines empirical data about educational curricula from diverse informatics programs and several published competency sets. It also provides a foundation for discussion of BMHI education as a whole and can help define subdisciplinary competencies.},

To reflect about medical informatics as a discipline. To suggest significant future research directions with the purpose of stimulating further discussion.
Methods
Exploring and discussing important developments in medical informatics from the past and in the present by way of examples. Reflecting on the role of IMIA, the International Medical Informatics Association, in influencing the discipline.
Results
Medical informatics as a discipline is still young. Today, as a cross-sectional discipline, it forms one of the bases for medicine and health care. As a consequence considerable responsibility rests on medical informatics for improving the health of people, through its contributions to high-quality, efficient health care and to innovative research in biomedicine and related health and computer sciences. Current major research fields can be grouped according to the organization, application, and evaluation of health information systems, to medical knowledge representation, and to the underlying signal and data analyses and interpretations. Yet, given the fluid nature of many of the driving forces behind progress in information processing methods and their technologies, progress in medicine and health care, and the rapidly changing needs, requirements and expectations of human societies, we can expect many changes in future medical informatics research. Future research fields might range from seamless interactivity with automated data capture and storage, via informatics diagnostics and therapeutics, to living labs with data analysis methodology, involving sensor-enhanced ambient environments. The role of IMIA, the International Medical Informatics Association, for building a cooperative, strongly connected, and research-driven medical informatics community worldwide can hardly be underestimated.
Conclusions
Health care continuously changes as the underlying science and practice of health are in continuous transformation. Medical informatics as a discipline is strongly affected by these changes and is in a position to be a key, active contributor in these changes.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid pace of change in technology and its impact on society, there is an increasing demand for use of Technology Forecasting methods to improve policy planning and implementation. One such area is the field of Health Care and the impact of Health Information Technology (HIT) on this field. Using HIT has shown to be associated with reduced cost, improved quality, and better patient experience; yet HIT adoption has been slow. Therefore, there is a need to better understand the HIT adoption processes in order to meet the evolving requirements for health care delivery.

We propose collecting Technology Intelligence for use in Research Forecasting as part of the larger HIT Technology Forecasting efforts. In this study, we systematically probed for HIT-related technology intelligence in the fields of Information Systems, Engineering Management, and Medical Informatics. Results of our analysis show that all three fields are active in Health IT research, but could benefit from further collaboration. We were also able to identify instances of emerging journals and emerging topics in Health IT research. We conclude that it is indeed plausible and meaningful to collect technology intelligence on HIT adoption, to support the overall goal of improving healthcare delivery.},

There is an increasing need for a larger and better trained workforce in medical informatics. The goal of the American Medical Informatics Association 10 × 10 program is to educate 10,000 clinicians in medical informatics by the year 2010.
Methods
We adapted an on-line introductory graduate course toward this goal. It was evaluated using Likert-scale and open-ended questions.
Results
The course was successfully implemented and attracted 51 individuals, 44 of whom completed it. The evaluation was generally positive, with all but one Likert-scale above 4.0 on a 1-to-5 scale.
Conclusions
We successfully adapted an introductory medical informatics course to a larger audience. The evaluation showed it was received positively and we have further plans to scale it to an even larger audience to meet the goals of the 10 × 10 program.},

Application of computers in health care has not kept pace with available technology. One substantial factor in this relative lack of progress is the need for more and better trained health computing professionals. Although a number of graduate and post-doctoral programs do exist, these have had little identifiable impact. A part of this problem is due to the fact that career rewards are lacking because the discipline has not been well defined and there is no concrete professional identity among health computing specialists. The ACM Curriculum Sub-Committee on Health Computing Education was founded in the belief that a model curriculum for health computing could provide the foundation and the needed impetus for acceptance of health computing as a discipline or profession. The group has been working since June, 1977, to establish such a model curriculum, and this paper reports on the curriculum status. The group has evolved a core curriculum and has outlined the four specialty areas, or tracks, in which graduates may work. The core curriculum is described, and the probable career paths and training proposed for each of the tracks are discussed.},

Because these new products appear highly intangible, this renews the debate about intangibility as defined in the marketing literature, which has traditionally considered it as a unidimensional or two-dimensional construct and has associated it almost exclusively with services. The objective of this study is to show that intangibility is a three-dimensional construct. A survey was conducted, and structural equation modeling analyses were used to test the proposed scale. Results showed that intangibility is indeed composed of three dimensions: mental intangibility, physical intangibility, and generality. The scale was then applied to some goods and services, and it was found that some goods appear to be less tangible than many services. These results suggest the need for some changes in how service marketing research is carried out and how managers deal with the “intangibility” of their services.},

	abstract = {In our high-tech society, the design process involves profound questions about the effects of the resulting goods, and the responsibilities of designers. In the philosophy of technology, effects of "things" on user experience and behaviour have been discussed in terms of the concept of technological mediation. Meanwhile, what we create has moved more and more towards services (processes) rather than products (things), in particular in the context of information services. The question is raised to what extent the concept of technological mediation is adequate to understand effects and responsibilities in information services as well. Therefore, this paper discusses differences between product aspects and service aspects of our creations, and evaluates the applicability of the concept of technological mediation to information services. Specific features of a notion of technological mediation for information services are highlighted, in particular with respect to the different relation between production and consumption. Finally, the paper focuses on the ethical consequences of service impact, and recommendations for service providers, especially in terms of the possibilities for second-order mediation by inviting users to change service properties. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Through such public-private partnerships, governments hope to avoid up-front capital expenditure and to harness private-sector efficiencies, while private-sector partners aim for a return on investment. Our research indicates that to date, experience with these partnerships has been mixed. Early models of these partnerships—for example, in which a private firm builds a hospital and carries out building maintenance, which we term an “accommodation-only” model—arguably have not met expectations for achieving greater efficiencies at lower costs. Newer models described in this article offer greater opportunities for efficiency gains but are administratively harder to set up and manage. Given the shortages in public capital for new infrastructure, it seems likely that the attractiveness of these partnerships to European governments will grow.},

This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960–1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social–ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge–system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

	abstract = {Contemporary science is preoccupied with that which exists; it rarely accounts for what is missing. But often the key to a system's persistence lies with information concerning lacunae. Information theory (IT), predicated as it is on the indeterminacies of existence, constitutes a natural tool for quantifying the beneficial reserves that lacunae can afford a system in its response to disturbance. In the format of IT, unutilized reserve capacity is complementary to the effective performance of the system, and too little of either attribute can render a system unsustainable. The fundamental calculus of IT provides a uniform way to quantify both essential attributes – effective performance and reserve capacity – and results in a single metric that gauges system sustainability (robustness) in terms of the tradeoff allotment of each. Furthermore, the same mathematics allows one to identify the domain of robust balance as delimited to a “window of vitality” that circumscribes sustainable behavior in ecosystems. Sensitivity analysis on this robustness function with respect to each individual component process quantifies the value of that link “at the margin”, i.e., how much each unit of that process contributes to moving the system towards its most sustainable configuration. The analysis provides heretofore missing theoretical justification for efforts to preserve biodiversity whenever systems have become too streamlined and efficient. Similar considerations should apply as well to economic systems, where fostering diversity among economic processes and currencies appears warranted in the face of over-development.},

Resiliency can be defined as a composite of: (1) the ability of a network to provide service despite external failures and (2) the time to restore service when in the presence of such failures. Although, Resiliency has been extensively studied in different research areas, this paper will study the specific aspects of quantifiable network resiliency when the network is experiencing potential catastrophic failures from external events and/or influences, and when it is not known a priori which specific components within the network will fail. A formal definition for Category I resiliency is proposed and a step-by-step approach based on Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate it is defined. To illustrate the approach, two-terminal networks with varying degrees of redundancy, have been considered. The results obtained for test networks show that this new quantifiable concept of resiliency provides insight into the performance and topology of the network. Future use for this work could include methods for safeguarding critical network components and optimizing the use of redundancy as a technique to improve network resiliency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This network perspective might be useful for developing formal models and comparing case studies of social-ecological systems. Based on an analysis of the case studies in this special issue, we identify three types of social-ecological networks: (1) ecosystems that are connected by people through flows of information or materials, (2) ecosystem networks that are disconnected and fragmented by the actions of people, and (3) artificial ecological networks created by people, such as irrigation systems. Each of these three archytypal social-ecological networks faces different problems that influence its resilience as it responds to the addition or removal of connections that affect its coordination or the diffusion of system attributes such as information or disease.

A corollary is derived from the CAP theorem, and states that it is impossible for a system to have all three properties of consistency, resilience and partition-tolerance. We present seven architectural constraints for resilience. The constraints are elicited from good architectural practices for developing reliable and fault-tolerant systems and the state-of-the-art technologies in distributed computing.

	abstract = {Sustainability as a concept has multiple disparate perspectives stemming from different related disciplines which either maintain ambiguous interpretations or concentrate on metrics pertaining to single aspects of a system. Given the embedded multi-dimensionality of sustainability, systemic approaches are needed that can cope with interactions of different dimensions. Past efforts for measuring sustainability holistically have taken an accounting approach based on the availability and efficiency of resource flows. However, an accounting approach fails to fully incorporate the intensive parameters pertaining to sustainability. An ecological information-based approach is a promising holistic measurement which incorporates both intensive and extensive dimensions of sustainability. This paper evaluates this approach by applying it to six economic resource trade flow networks: virtual water, oil, world commodity, OECD + BRIC commodity, OECD + BRIC foreign direct investment, and iron and steel. From the perspective of biomimicry, it appears that these networks can achieve higher levels of efficiency without weakening their robustness to resource delivery. The trends of measured efficiency and redundancy of the studied networks are demonstrated to be useful in reflecting long term changes while the trend in robustness levels were found to exhibit similar behavior to an ecosystem in its early phase of development.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure resilience has drawn significant attention in recent years, partly because the occurrence of low–probability and high–consequence disruptive events like Hurricane Katrina, the Indonesian tsunami, terrorism attack in New York, and others. Since civil infrastructure systems support society welfare and viability, continuous infrastructural operation is critical. Along protection approaches, resilience concepts support achievement of near–continuous infrastructure operation. A variety of frameworks, models, and tools exist for advancing infrastructure resilience research. Nevertheless, translation of resilience concepts into practical methodologies for informing civil infrastructure operation and management remains challenging. This paper presents a state–of–the–art literature review on civil infrastructure resilience, particularly water distribution systems, enabling practical applications of infrastructure resilience towards improved system management. The literature review has two stages, quantitative and qualitative. Infrastructure resilience is defined to provide a foundation for operationalisation of infrastructure resilience concepts, enabling the inclusion of practical resilience considerations in formal management systems such as infrastructure asset management systems.},

After examining the similarities and differences among human and natural systems, as well as the means by which they can be accounted for in theories and models, the book examines five efforts to describe human-natural systems. The point of these efforts is to provide the means of learning about those systems so that they can be managed adaptively. The final section of the book uses case studies to examine the application of integrated theories/models to the real world.},

	abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the ‘truth’ of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements.
Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot.
The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

Knowledge relevant to these resources is typically dispersed over a wide range of artifacts, representation formats, and abstraction levels.

In our research, we focus on assessing non-functional quality requirements, specifically evolvability, through semantic modeling of relevant software artifacts. We introduce our SE-Advisor that supports the integration of knowledge resources typically found in software ecosystems by providing a unified ontological representation. We further illustrate how our SE-Advisor takes advantage of this unified representation to support the analysis and assessment of different types of quality attributes related to the evolvability of software ecosystems.},

CONON provides an upper context ontology that captures general concepts about basic context, and also provides extensibility for adding domain-specific ontology in a hierarchical manner. Based on this context ontology, we have studied the use of logic reasoning to check the consistency of context information, and to reason over low-level, explicit context to derive high-level, implicit context. By giving a performance study for our prototype, we quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of logic based context reasoning for nontime-critical applications in pervasive computing environments, where we always have to deal carefully with the limitation of computational resources.},

	abstract = {The development of large-scale software product-lines within large enterprises commonly involves various internal business units. Although within the same enterprise, each business unit has individual motivations and participation interests. For coordinating development, the emerging discipline of software ecosystems intents to explicitly discover and analyze the different players' interests, and manage them, often by means of a suitable software architecture. Already within a single enterprise, this discipline can be of high value. Instead of detailed managerial orders to coordinate internal interactions, an analysis of the players, their interests, and a suitable software architecture may slacken organizational structures and simplify processes. We have started to analyze the ecosystems of several Siemens internal product-lines in order to determine the different players and their interests, and to derive suitable software architectural requirements from this setting. This will enable us to compare these requirements to the actual architecture, for identifying reusable pain points and best practices of the existing system. However, there is no systematic (A) approach to model and analyze the collaboration among the participants from a technical perspective, as well as (B) to derive reusable architectural design-patterns and anti-patterns from such software ecosystems. By illustrating these problems using an existing software productline that moves towards a software ecosystem, we are looking for answers to the two questions above to evaluate whether our product-lines are fit for a future as internal software ecosystems.},

This article elicits a set of five principles and associated criteria to help assure both the rigor and the relevance of CAR in information systems. The first principle relates to the development of an agreement that facilitates collaboration between the action researcher and the client. The second principle is based upon a cyclical process model for action research that consists of five stages: diagnosis, planning, intervention, evaluation and reflection. Additional principles highlight the critical roles of theory, change through action, and the specification of learning in terms of implications for both research and practice. The five principles are illustrated through the analysis of one recently published CAR study.},

The novel approach with supporting tools enables the systematic development of high quality software by merging benefits of knowledge modelling and management, and model driven architecture design enhanced with domain-specific quality attributes. The whole design flow of software engineering is semi-automatic; specifying quality requirements, transforming quality requirements to architecture design, representing quality properties in architectural models, predicting quality fulfilment from architectural models, and finally, measuring quality aspects from implemented source code. The semi-automatic design flow is exemplified by the ongoing development of a secure middleware for peer-to-peer embedded systems.},

The contributors - leading ecologists, philosophers, and economists - analyze the normative, conceptual, and biological issues surrounding the idea of ecosystem health. They examine both theoretical and practical aspects of the issues, and look at philosophical and ethical underpinnings as well as implications for public policy and ecosystems management. Ecosystem Health is a groundbreaking attempt to formulate an understanding of the quality and health of natural environments so that regulatory mandates can be brought in line with legislative goals. Ultimately, it seeks a new ethic of sustainability that will serve to protect the vital processes of nature.},

Various ontology alignment strategies have been proposed; however, few systems have explored how to automatically combine multiple strategies to improve the matching effectiveness. This paper presents a dynamic multistrategy ontology alignment framework, named RiMOM. The key insight in this framework is that similarity characteristics between ontologies may vary widely. We propose a systematic approach to quantitatively estimate the similarity characteristics for each alignment task and propose a strategy selection method to automatically combine the matching strategies based on two estimated factors. In the approach, we consider both textual and structural characteristics of ontologies. With RiMOM, we participated in the 2006 and 2007 campaigns of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). Our system is among the top three performers in benchmark data sets. © 2006 IEEE.},

This paper investigates the usefulness of integrating taxonomy information into classifier construction. In particular, it presents a general-purpose strategy to improve structured data classification accuracy by enriching data with semantics-based knowledge provided by a taxonomy (i.e., a set of is-a hierarchies) built over data items. The proposed approach may be deemed particularly useful by experts who could directly access or easily infer meaningful taxonomy models over the analyzed data. To demonstrate the benefit obtained from utilizing taxonomies for contemporary classification methods, we also presented a generalized version of a state-of-the-art associative classifier, which also includes generalized (high level) rules in the classification model.

A growing number of model organism databases and genome annotation groups contribute annotation sets using GO terms to GO's public repository. Updates to the AmiGO browser have improved access to contributed genome annotations. As the GO project continues to grow, the use of the GO vocabularies is becoming more varied as well as more widespread. The GO project provides an ontological annotation system that enables biologists to infer knowledge from large amounts of data.},

We have developed a novel framework- based on the well established foundations of information theory- that allows for the evaluation of new types of hypotheses. The framework, encapsulated in open biomedical ontology-based exploration and search (OBOES), has already been applied in the investigation of different kinds of questions. The resulting framework enables the new field of information theoretic ontology-based analysis. We have applied this framework to create methods to re-engineer ontologies, explore fundamental questions on the evolution of biological complexity, determine optimal ontology terms for bioinformatics analysis, and quantify the usefulness of biofluids as proxies for tissues/diseases. In each case, we found that our methods provide novel, significant findings. An open source Java implementation of OBOES is available at: http://oboes.sourceforge.net.},

Ontology matching is applied as a reasoning mechanism in automatically generating traceability relationships. The relationships are identified by deriving semantic analogy of ontology concepts representing requirements elements. The precision and recall of traceability relationships generated by the framework are verified by comparing with a set of traceability relationships manually identified by users as a proof-of-concept of this framework.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls are one of the most common medical complications post-stroke. Physical exercise, particularly exercise that challenges balance, reduces the risk of falls among healthy and frail older adults. However, exercise has not proven effective for preventing falls post-stroke. Falls ultimately occur when an individual fails to recover from a loss of balance. Thus, training to specifically improve reactive balance control could prevent falls. Perturbation training aims to improve reactive balance control by repeatedly exposing participants to postural perturbations. There is emerging evidence that perturbation training reduces fall rates among individuals with neurological conditions, such as Parkinson disease. The primary aim of this work is to determine if perturbation-based balance training can reduce occurrence of falls in daily life among individuals with chronic stroke. Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of perturbation training on balance confidence and activity restriction, and functional balance and mobility.
METHODS/DESIGN: Individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) perturbation training, or 2) 'traditional' balance training. Perturbation training will involve both manual perturbations (e.g., a push or pull from a physiotherapist), and rapid voluntary movements to cause a loss of balance. Training will occur twice per week for 6 weeks. Participants will record falls and activity for 12 months following completion of the training program. Standardized clinical tools will be used to assess functional balance and mobility, and balance confidence before and after training.
DISCUSSION: Falls are a significant problem for those with stroke. Despite the large body of work demonstrating effective interventions, such as exercise, for preventing falls in other populations, there is little evidence for interventions that prevent falls post-stroke. The proposed study will investigate a novel and promising intervention: perturbation training. If effective, this training has the potential to not only prevent falls, but to also improve safe independent mobility and engagement in daily activities for those with stroke.
